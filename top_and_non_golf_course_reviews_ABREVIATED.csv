1,Pine Valley,top100,"Pine Valley, NJ",George Crump / Harry S. Colt,1918,PINE VALLEY GOLF CLUB - 19 POINTS,David Jones,rev01_pine_valley_1,"There’s not much point trying to do a hole-by-hole guide to Pine Valley since others have done a much better job than I could do, for example, the majestic flyover from Golf Digest a couple of years ago. Drone photography can often flatter a golf course - but not in this case. While it’s a great piece of work, I’m still not sure it quite does justice to the real thing.

So, instead of trying to do a course guide, I have some observations on what it is like to play the course as a pretty average golfer (I’m a 12 handicapper) and then a few tips about what to expect more generally if you find yourself with a tee time.

The fairways are much wider than they look...
Every single drive has a forced carry and you can rarely see the landing area. That’s really quite intimidating! However, I hit a pretty average length - usually driving about 230 yards - and from the men’s tees I was able to carry them all without any real issues. When you get over the carry (which normally includes a lot of sand) you will normally find a generous fairway which you just couldn’t see from the tee. A few times we hit what felt like pretty significant hooks or slices only to find the ball safely on the short stuff, no problem.

This meant that the second time we played (lucky I know!) it was far less intimidating from the tee box as we knew what was coming.
The 18th at Pine Valley is wide enough seen from above, but you can’t see the width of the fairway from the tee

 …however, the approaches are devilish
Pretty much half of your approaches will require a carry to the green with anything short being punished, at times brutally. When you combine that with the significant elevation change, you will often find this makes for a very tough second-shot course. So you really need to listen to your caddie and commit to the shots. When I did that, I tended to find I would get over the trouble. Anything less than 100% and you are in for problems. Also, there is no disgrace in laying up to the par 4s and going in with a wedge in three rather than trying to be an unlikely hero from a distance.
Some spots in the sand can be tricky to get out of!

Sand, sand, everywhere - and always a bugger to get out of
When you do come up short you will, more often than not, find your ball in the sand. I say sand rather than bunker as it is more like a waste area and certainly doesn’t play like a traditional bunker,

The lies are often very tight, indeed sometimes - like at the ‘Devil’s Asshole’ bunker on the 10th - there is just no sand in it at all. This takes a lot of getting used and I suspect for some you never do. You will find all manner of challenges - sometimes in a hard baked trench, sometimes against a cliff face with no possibility of a shot. You can take many, many shots trying to get out and the ruling allowing you to take a drop out of a bunker for a 2 shot penalty could be a valuable one to remember. I can only imagine how it must be to play in a medal, with a card in your hand. Terrifying!

The greens are often massive, and always wicked
So you’ve made the green in regulation having hit the wide fairway and nailed your approach. All is good, right? Alas, no. These greens are often vast and there is a lot of movement, so getting down in 2 is often a challenge beyond anyone but the very best putter. Again, listen to your caddie and make sure you ask for reads on all putts. Even the shortest can move hard.

Always take your punishment
While the fairways are wide, it is unlikely you are going to hit them all (although the 75 year old member I played with only missed one in two rounds!). Pine Valley shares some characteristics with the Australian Sandbelt and there is very little rough on the course. The trees which frame many holes don’t come into play too much either. If you miss a fairway you are likely to go straight into the sand or scrub and find yourself often with a very wonky stance or gnarly lie. You will soon learn not to be greedy, not to try and be a hero, but just to put it back on the short stuff. I know that’s advice you will get on most courses but believe me, it is essential here.
The par 3 fifth at Pine Valley - just another amazing hole!

Two rounds are definitely better than 1!
I was lucky enough to play the course twice on the same trip and that really helped to elevate my enjoyment. The first time I was a little tight and intimidated, the next morning I had a much better idea of what was going on and scored pretty well. 31 points off the members’ tees was as much as I could have possibly hoped for, and while I left a few out there, I managed my way around the course pretty well knowing what I could and couldn’t do.

 It really is a thing of beauty
The course is a truly special place. Visually, it is stunning with the colours of the trees, sand and grasses making it look like a magnificent painting. Most holes are self contained, you don’t see others playing as you walk around, and there is no traffic to speak of. It is an incredibly peaceful and tranquil place. 

I hope that helps should you find yourself getting the call to play the course. However, Pine Valley is about more than just the course. 

TOUR TIPS
The entrance to Pine Valley
So, the invite has come and you are all set for Pine Valley. What’s the on-property etiquette and how expensive is the wine I hear you ask? Fear not, read on…

Getting to Pine Valley
You’ve probably read a little about the arrival at the property. Apparently it used to be quite a feat finding the little turn off for Pine Valley but Google Maps has changed all that. Still, it is fun turning past the Clementon Amusement  Park, through a very ordinary looking conurbation, but safe in the knowledge you are just minutes away from possibly the finest golf course in the world!

On arrival, staff at the guardhouse will check that you are on the list and your member is awaiting you. It’s all very discreet but it’s quite clear, if you’re not on the list, you’re not getting in. Pine Valley is large property, so savour the drive in. And to whet the appetite, you’ll actually cross the 18th hole as you reach the clubhouse.

Accommodation at Pine Valley
Hopefully your invite to play at Pine Valley will come with a request to stay the night on the property too. You can only play the course if you are accompanied by a member. The only exception to this is if your member is too infirm to play but has maintained his membership. Either way, your member needs to be on site at all times. Not only that, but expect him to stay close by your side. It’s all done in a very friendly way, but it’s not an accident when he meets you outside your room in the morning not in the breakfast hall!

There are three main types of accommodation at Pine Valley. Firstly, the lodge, which is just next to the clubhouse with one side looking over the fourth fairway and green and the other side facing up the par 3 fifth. The lodge comprises a couple of dozen bedrooms – each with a double bed, cable TV and comfortable shower. The rooms are probably a solid four star hotel standard, so a step up from some on site golf accommodation. The showers were very good, the beds comfy and you could leave your shoes outside your door to be cleaned overnight! Oh, and there are no locks on the doors here, inside or out. They’re a very trusting lot at Pine Valley!

Next door is the dormitory. Accommodation is a little more basic here, including communal showers. Still, if that is the price to pay to be a minute’s walk from the first tee at Pine Valley then so be it!

Members also use many of the private houses scattered all over this vast property so you may well find yourself staying the night tucked behind any green or tee, which would be a pretty nice view to wake up to.

Learn the secret code
There is clearly an etiquette here that members introduce themselves to anyone that they see. The secret to knowing whether you’re talking to a member or another guest is that members will have the Pine Valley logo on their hat/shirt/top without the words ‘Pine Valley’. This ‘no script’ apparel marks them out as one of the chosen ones. Be prepared to do a lot of smiling and introducing!

The clubhouse
The clubhouse itself at Pine Valley is a modest affair. Think antiquated charm rather than modern bling! The locker rooms are functional rather than fancy and the bar is short but well stocked. The vibe is that this is a club for proper golfers. There’s no Country Club atmosphere here – people are here for the golf.

While the main purpose of the clubhouse is functional, there are displays of hickories from days gone by, including several Tom Morris clubs, as well as many fine portraits and trophies adorning the walls so do make sure you get some time to dwell and take it all in.

Eating at Pine Valley
The restaurant is neither large nor overly formal, but the staff will make you feel very welcome and there’s no need to stand on ceremony. For lunch we had the turtle snapper soup and a sandwich – a Pine Valley classic. The sherry was passed around to put in the soup and it was actually very pleasant. You’re fine with soft spikes in the clubhouse and everyone is in golf gear during the day. No Muirfield-style dressing for lunch here.

Dress in the evening time is smarter, the members will have their green jackets on and it’s blazers, ties and slacks all round. We were there in September and the place was jumping. In fact I heard one of the members saying that it was proving hard to get another time in that season, so busy was the course and accommodation. The food is good quality - don’t expect quite Michelin fare and you’ll be fine - and the wine list is extensive but reasonably priced.

This isn’t a place where you should expect a lock-in until the early hours (although I’m sure it happens occasionally!). By 10:30pm it was thinning out and most were off to their beds.

Breakfast the next morning was good too - plenty of fruit, cereal, possibly the best bacon I’ve ever had and an egg station. All excellent!

Hitting the range
The driving range at Pine Valley is one of the very best around, as you’d imagine. It’s a little way from the clubhouse and first tee so you’ll probably get a lift from one of the staff who will arrange a time to come and get you back too. There are plenty of Pro V1s and you’ll be hitting to greens with precise yardages from every hitting spot – you don’t see that every day. There’s also a good short game area. For putting, there’s a green right next to the 18th green and 1st tee box. Plenty of time to build up the anticipation before hitting what may be the most nerve-wracking first drive of your life (oh, and no mulligans!!)

The scorecard at the short course at Pine Valley

Time for 10 more?
While there’s no doubt that Pine Valley is a mentally and physically demanding course, it would be a real shame to play here and not visit the 10-hole Tom Fazio creation that opened in 1992. 8 of the 10 holes are exact replicas of approach shots you will find on the course (at 2, 3, 10, 13, 14, 15, 17, 18) and there are a further 2 original creations. The hitting area on the holes will be moved anywhere between 327 and 86 yards so you get a good test of different approaches. When we played they seemed mainly to be over 170 yards, so it was no push over. In fact, without the caddies and the vegetation grown up a bit more, the balls were actually harder to find. Amazingly the holes really do look and feel like the originals – the elevation change is the same, as is the direction, so you get a really authentic experience.

The pro shop
OK, so that’s all well and good, but we know what you’re really here for. It’s all about the swag of course. You will be glad to know there is a very well stocked pro shop in the clubhouse. I was slightly nervous here since I didn’t want to look like a Bag-Tag-Barry but equally I was keen not to let this moment pass without a few memories for me. And my friends. And my family. And anyone else who knows me.

Rather intimidatingly there are no prices on anything so you need to use some care as you are piling up your purchases but the costs aren’t any higher than you would expect to see at any other shop of its ilk. Also, unlike at some private clubs in the US you don’t have to put these purchases on your host’s account - they will happily take your credit card. I suspect they have seen it all here, so don’t be shy about buying all you want!

But what about the Bag Tag?
Every guest is given a bag tag that one of the guys there will attach to your bag with a set of pliers. I am in two minds about whether it’s a nice touch or a bit ‘show-offy’ move, but the tag is still on my bag while I decide!
Pine Valley Bag Tag
So there you have it, the whole experience at Pine Valley is tremendous and I hope this has given you a little taste of what to expect if you get the invite! As for where else to play if you’re in the area, it would clearly be worth the trip just to play Pine Valley but the perfect doubler would be Merion, just an hour away. My only advice would be try to play Merion first so you can save the best until last!"

Colt,1918,"Pine Valley Golf Club (Clementon, New Jersey)",Bill Satterfield,rev02_pine_valley_2,"What to Expect:  Pine Valley is the finest golf course on the planet. It holds the royal flush of attributes: variety, memorability, tradition, difficulty, and pristine conditions. Plenty of courses want to claim they have 18 signature holes, but Pine Valley can make a stronger argument for that title than any other course in the world. It is hard to imagine that a course of Pine Valley's caliber could be better than it is hyped up to be; but it is. Our friend and host, a longtime Pine Valley member, had this to say, ""Pine Valley is underrated as the #1 course in the world."" Pine Valley is so good it is in a league of its own. The walking-only course is set on nearly 200 acres of sandy terrain that features tons of pine trees and marvelous elevation changes. Though often classified as a penal course, the fairway widths are quite generous and the green complexes are spectacular. Identifying the best hole on the course is like trying to pick your favorite child; it is nearly impossible because they are all so good for different reasons. The world class driving range, about a mile from the clubhouse, features precise yardages from each bag stand to each flag in the field so there is no excuses for not being ""dialed in"" before your round. Lastly, the caddies are all dressed in white, which is a further indication that Pine Valley may actually be heaven on earth!

Individual Hole Analysis
Signature Hole:  Honestly, how can you just pick one?! In fact, it might be easier to try and identify a hole that wouldn't be considered the signature hole . . . maybe. Never has this category seemed so futile then when trying to write a review on Pine Valley. Pine Valley really deserves a hole-by-hole review, but since that isn't the format I use I'll simply include photos of a couple of the holes I loved that aren't featured in the rest of the review.

Best Par 3:  5th Hole – 238 Yards – Ranked in 1999 among Golf Digest's 99 Greatest Holes in America, the 5th hole at Pine Valley is one of the finest and most difficult one-shotters you'll come across. The tee box to the fifth hole rests behind the clubhouse and travels a totally different direction than the previous par three. Playing uphill from tee to green, your tee shot must carry a water hazard just beyond the tee box before also needing to carry the cross bunker. Most tee shots will come up short and find a portion of the fairway resting in front of the green while tee shots that leak right will find themselves in a deep bunker pinned up next to the trees. This is a very heroic hole where pars should be celebrated like birdies!

5th Hole at Pine Valley Golf Club (238 Yard Par 3)

Best Par 4:  13th Hole – 486 Yards – Bobby Jones referenced this hole as the greatest par four in the world, and I'm not going to argue. It only ranked behind the 8th at Pebble Beach and 17th at Cypress Point on Golf Digest's list of greatest par 4s in America. The tee box to this hole is tucked back into the tree and affords the golfer only a slivers view of the uphill fairway. After placing your tee shot in the fairway, the golfer is treated to a view of the green and watches the hole unfold as the fairway bottlenecks and then turns left before widening and pushing back the deep waste areas running along the fairway edges. From most tee shots, the straightest line to the green requires challenging the bunkers up the left side of the hole while a large landing area to the right is afforded to golfers not feeling quite as bold. The 13th at Pine Valley is a wonderful challenge that delivers options and excitement every loop you make.

13th Hole at Pine Valley Golf Club (486 Yard Par 4)

Best Par 5:  15th Hole – 615 Yards – After completing two exceptional holes in the par four 13th and par three 14th, the golfer is handed a treat with the par five 15th which is one of only two such par rated holes on the course. While at some courses the par fives are looked at as a chance to feel some reprieve and score low, it is quite the opposite at Pine Valley. The 15th hole demands a tee shot that will carry the large water hazard off the tee before coming to rest on the left-to-right sloping fairway. Plenty of fairway width is afforded to the golfer initially, but closes down and runs uphill more and more as the green is approached. At 615 yards the hole is long by anyone's standard, but the steady climb uphill makes the hole feel and play even longer and can mentally overcome a golfer that isn't prepared for the challenge. It is a wonderful hole and a fitting challenge for a course of Pine Valley's caliber.

15th Hole at Pine Valley Golf Club (615 Yard Par 5)

Birdie Time:  10th Hole – 161 Yard Par 3 – The shortest hole on the course isn't short on accolades or impressive features; however it does deliver the best opportunity to score a birdie. The green creates an inland island surrounded by sand and hosts one of the smaller putting surface at the course. The distance is such that dead aim can be taken at most pin locations, but properly guiding your ball into the hole on the sloped putting surface is where the real challenge lies here. With so many challenges at Pine Valley, this is your chance to try and take a stroke back from old man par.

10th Hole at Pine Valley Golf Club (161 Yard Par 3)
Bogey Beware:  7th Hole – 636 Yard Par 5 – The 7th hole boasts one of the largest and most famous interior hazards in all of golf; the notorious Hell's Half Acre bunker. Spanning the entire width of the fairway, the bunker contains natural foliage and runs nearly 100 yards in length, epitomizing Sahara style bunkering. At 636 yards, bogey is already something most golfers will have to concede a bogey on. But with Hell's Half Acre bunker in the middle of the hole, tee balls that don't find the fairway will be forced to punch out short of the bunker before proceeding over. For those not willing to let Hell's Half Acre intimidate them, there is the option of taking your chances on what kind of lie you will get in the heavily travelled sand, but scores rarely finish low with that strategy. Even though this hole encompasses the flattest terrain on the property, there are a myriad of challenges awaiting the golfer that can't hit the ball high and straight."

I had an early morning tee time at Cypress Point, and the solitary drive down from San Francisco allowed plenty of time to reflect on the upcoming round. I purposefully drove the scenic California Highway 1 all the way down to coast early that morning, and anticipation for the round peaked as I pulled onto the famous 17 Mile Drive.
DSC00792I pulled past the often photographed “Cypress Point Club – Members Only” signs and walked into the pro shop both nervous and incredibly excited for my round of golf. The club’s professional staff immediately greeted me, and made me feel like I was at my home club. The head pro talked to me as if I was an old friend, offering a tour of the locker room and his assistant chatted with me at length about having lived in St Andrews. Their hospitality made me feel very welcome and added a great element to the experience. I was introduced to my caddie for the day, Marty, a 78 year old who had spent over 25 years at the club, and we set off on a brisk Monterey Peninsula morning!


As I do with nearly all rounds, I read as much as possible about Cypress Point Club before making the journey out to California. On the flight from North Carolina, I combed through Geoff Shackleford’s, Alister Mackenzie’s Cypress Point Club. Two people played the main roles in creating Cypress Point. The first person is Samuel Morse, who was the main developer for much of the Monterey Peninsula area, including Pebble Beach Golf Links. Morse hired the second major name, Marion Hollins, who recruited members, personally hired Alister MacKenzie, and oversaw much of the course construction. She was an excellent player in her own right, and it was her eye for detail and quality that took Cypress to the next level. Both founders had the vision and business knowledge to conceive and build one of the best golf courses in the world. Additionally, the club was built and created during a time when most were failing, the Great Depression. The first round of golf was played at Cypress Point in August, 1928.

Whenever I play a particularly good golf course, I look back on the round and try to encapsulate in my mind what made it a particularly great design. In a number of cases, such as Pine Valley, it is difficult to pick out a single weak hole. That was the case at Cypress Point. It was certainly one of the best and most picturesque settings I have ever had for a round of golf, but the strength of the design was never compromised for the view. 

Hole #1 – 420 yards
The opening hole plays to a wide fairway with a group of fairway bunkers on the left. The approach, seen in the photo above, plays uphill to a large green. 

Hole #2 – 549 yards
The second hole requires a carry to reach the fairway, which works left towards the green. Longer hitters can cut off more of the fairway, leaving a shorter second shot into this fairly long par 5. Beautiful homes line the second fairway, nearly all of which are owned by Cypress Point members.

Hole #3 – 156 yards
 DSC00774 Five bunkers guard this par 3, which provides a visually intimidating view from the tee box. MacKenzie had a theory of making holes appear more difficult than they actually were, and the 3rd is a great example.

Hole #4 – 383 yards

MacKenzie played visual tricks from this tee box. It looks like a sea of bunkers directly in the landing area, and the temptation is to try and “thread the needle” down the left side of the fairway. Thanks to my sage caddie, Marty, I knew there was plenty of room  in the landing area, and took my tee ball directly at the right fairway bunkers. A caddie was crucial during this round.

Hole #5 – 491 yards

The 5th is another bunkering masterclass. The bunkers on the right side of the fairway were not in range for me from the tips, but longer hitters, or forward tees, may bring them into play. Layups need to stay about 80-100 yards short of the green to avoid bunkers and leave a wedge into a two tiered sloping putting surface.

Hole #6 – 521 yards

The second of these back-to-back par 5s is reachable with the correct tee shot. A draw off the left hand side of the right fairway bunkers leaves a lengthy, but reachable, second shot into the green.

Hole #7 – 170 yards

I took an extra club on this beautiful par 3. An area left of the green allows for shots to kick right onto the putting surface. The pin was tucked in the right corner during my round.

Hole #8 – 369 yards

The 8th is the only blind tee shot at Cypress Point. A solid shot just right of the lone tree cuts the corner perfectly. Bolder players can cut off more or less depending on wind and bravery. A gargantuan dune swallows up any balls falling short of the fairway. A pair of deer followed us within 30 feet for the entirety of this hole.

Hole #9 – 289 yards

This short par 4 is drivable for longer hitters. My trusty caddie had taken Phil Mickelson for a loop at Cypress, and Phil hit his “Phrankenwood” 3-wood to 11 feet. The green is very shallow, sloping, and long as seen in the photo above taken from the back left corner of the putting surface.

Hole #11 – 440 yards

The drive on number 11 is straightforward, and in hindsight I should not have hit my driver. You may be able to spot my ball barely short of the right hand cross bunker. The bunkering on this hole creates a stunning view with a chute all the way to the green. The dune behind the green frames the hole nicely.

Hole #13 – 366 yards

Marty turned to me on the tee at 13 and said, “This is a birdie hole.” I didn’t even want to play this hole… I wanted to sit down on the tee box and enjoy the view for the rest of the day! The pin was in a receptive position on this sloping green, and I barely missed my birdie putt.

Hole #15 – 135 yards

The 15th is one of my favorite short par 3s that I have ever played. The 135 yard tee shot is directly over the Pacific Ocean. A pod of seals made plenty of noise as my adrenaline pumped during this tee shot. I like to think they were applauding the shot, which ended 8 feet from the hole. I sank the birdie, meaning I have now birdied arguably the two most famous par 3s in golf!

Hole #16 – 233 yards

The 16th is incredibly tough. The hole was a 240 yard shot during my round, and the carry directly towards the green was right at 225 yards. I decided to hit a punch driver intending for my miss to land in a greenside bunker. Shorter hitters have the option of playing out to the left to a fairway area, leaving a wedge to the green. I’d take my bogey and run on this hole!

Hole #17 – 386 yards

I hit driver from this tee box aiming slightly left of the group of fairway trees. In retrospect, I should have hit a hybrid and hit a longer iron into the green. My ball trickled into a bunker just left of the trees, which completely blocked me out from the green. It takes a perfect drive to have a clear shot to the green.

Hole #18 – 343 yards

The 18th hole at Cypress gains lots of criticism. I heard varying reviews of the hole before my round, and even my caddie called it a “connector hole” simply reaching back to the clubhouse. I didn’t totally agree. The tee shot is very demanding and takes a long cut in order to have a clear shot to the green. Even with what I thought was a great tee shot, I was blocked out by a tree, as seen in the lower of the two photos above. If you’ve played the course before, please comment with your thoughts on number 18!

My round at Cypress Point marked my 26th Top 100 in the World course played. Each course has been unique and incredibly enjoyable, but only at a handful was I treated better than at Cypress. The combination of the setting, history, prestige, and hospitality made it a day that I will never forget."

The course is so special, so magical, and so beautiful that it is difficult to portray the experience in writing. The club at Cypress Point delves deep to the roots of golf where players must walk their round, be accompanied by a club-carrying caddy, and rely on their caddy for distances since there are no yardage markers on the course. Gentlemen must wear a collard shirt and slacks while changing your shoes anywhere but in the locker room is stricly prohibited. Dr. Alister MacKenzie's work has set the standard by which golf course architecture is measured and the experience is second to none. If your hoping to join the club, you better track the obituaries because memberships don't open up at Cypress Point until someone dies - it's that special.

Individual Hole Analysis
Signature Hole:  16th Hole – 222 Yard Par 3 – This is one of the most famous and best holes on the known earth. Featuring the most exhilarating tee shot in golf, over 200 yards is required to carry the Pacific Ocean to a peninsula green framed by bunkers, rocks, and ice plant. A fairway left of the green is afforded as on option off the tee in the event the incoming winds are blowing too strong or if you just aren't feeling confident enough with your hybrid/fairway wood to fire straight at the green. The pinnacle of your golfing existence is reached on this tee box the first time you step on it.

16th Hole at Cypress Point Golf Club (222 Yard Par 3)
Best Par 3:  15th Hole – 135 Yards – Since the mind blowing 16th has already been featured as the signature hole, a review of Cypress Point wouldn't be complete without mention of the 16th's prettier and more playable little brother, the 15th. Playing just 135 yards, the stunningly beautiful 15th hole is surrounded by bunkers, oceans rocks, and cypress trees and offers the best chance for birdie of all the par threes. This hole represents the first of back-to-back par threes and the first hole of the best three hole stretch in all of golf.

15th Hole at Cypress Point Golf Club (135 Yard Par 3)
Best Par 4:  17th Hole – 386 Yards – This is simply one of the prettiest tee shots for a par four in all of golf. With the tee box sitting directly behind the 16th green on a peninsula jetting out into the Pacific, your tee shot gets blasted over the rocky coast to a landing area where a cluster of cypress trees await to cause havoc on your approach shot. The green slides back out toward the ocean and is surrounded by brilliant white sand bunkers and naturally jagged ocean rocks. The worst part of #17 is the feeling you get after holing out when you realize that you are only one hole away from having having to walk off perhaps the greatest course known to man.

17th Hole at Cypress Point Golf Club (386 Yard Par 4)

Best Par 5:  6th Hole – 521 Yards – I hope I don't get struck down for blasphemy by saying Cypress Point has a weak point, but clearly the par 5s at the course can't even begin to compete with the quality and drama the par 3s and 4s offer. The second of back-to-back par 5s, the sixth hole plays downhill with a fairway that slopes hard from right to left. With the portion of the fairway you want your tee shot to land out of sight from the tee box, a powerful draw will make this hole very reachable in two to one of the best green sites on the course. Classic MacKenzie bunkers surround the green site and beg the golfer to play it safe to the right side of the green and work the ball back toward the hole.

6th Hole at Cypress Point Golf Club (521 Yard Par 5)
Birdie Time:  9th Hole – 289 Yard Par 4 – One of the great short par fours in the world, the concluding hole of the outward nine is a sub-300 yarder that should get the adrenaline pumping. When the pin is in the lower tier on the right side of the green it begs long hitters to take out their driver and go for the heroic shot towards the flag. However, when perched in the upper left side of the green, sand fronts the entire putting surface on that line and cautions players from being too aggressive with their tee shot and to instead play to the fat portion of the fairway 50 yards shy of the center of the green. In match play, this is truly one of the best offerings to look forward to while looping around Cypress Point.

9th Hole at Cypress Point Golf Club (289 Yard Par 4)
Bogey Beware:  16th Hole – 222 Yard Par 3 – On the scorecard the 16th hole is identified as the #6 handicap. Trust me, not only does Cypress Point lack five holes that are more difficult, but there are few holes anywhere that are going to average more strokes over par than the par three 16th. Requiring a forced carry of 200 yards over the Pacific Ocean, many tee shots find a watery grave never to be heard from again. In fact, on a windy day it is not uncommon to see smart golfers play a 9 iron to the fairway left of the green followed up by a 9 iron into the green. Anytime laying up on a par three can be deemed an intelligent move even for scratch golfers, you know you've stepped onto one of the most difficult holes you'll ever have the pleasure of playing.

16th Hole at Cypress Point Golf Club (222 Yard Par 3)
"
5,Shinnecock Hills,top100,"Southampton, NY",William Flynn,1931,Review: Shinnecock Hills Golf Club,Andrew Harvie,rev05_shinnecock_1,"There’s not many courses as acclaimed, sought after or documented as Shinnecock Hills Golf Club. Originally built in the late 1800’s by Willie Davis, with Willy Dunn updating the course a couple years after it opened, C.B. Macdonald with Seth Raynor updating the layout in 1916, and finally, William Flynn, his partner Howard Toomey, and foreman Dick Wilson coming in 1931 to construct basically a new layout.

The design credit is given to William Flynn. The Macdonald golf course is gone, although the land where the current 3rd, 6th and 7th are remain fairly close to Macdonald’s Shinnecock Hills. Aside from the background, most people are aware of the championship pedigree of ‘Shinne’ and how notoriously difficult it is. It’s also well-known Shinnecock is one of the best in the world.

Shinnecock is one of the most difficult courses in the world, but it opens on a fairly gentle note. “Westwood Ho” is a 391 yard par 4 playing downhill into the bottom of the property.


Driver or three wood are fine off the tee for most. It’s not overly long and a nice introduction into the golf course.

However, the “gentle handshake” opener is really only on the opening tee shot. The green complexes here are so nasty and aggressive that there’s not a moment on this golf course you can walk through an approach shot. Ask Tiger Woods–he hit it over the green here in the 2018 US Open one round and made 7!


With a false front and a fall off over the back, it’s a difficult iron shot. For those who have played Pinehurst No. 2, the first green complex is similar at No. 2 as it is here, except Shinnecock’s is maybe three times as extreme.


The second hole is a long par 3 at 221 yards. “Plateau” is aptly named, with a green pushed up. A false front kicks balls to the right, while bunkering flanks the left side. Once again, the back edge falls off. The US Open tee here is 250 or so yards–insanity!


The third is another difficult hole at 470 yards, par 4. “Peconic,” named after the Peconic Bay that Shinnecock sits near (and National Golf Links of America sits on), is one of the more appealing tee shots on the golf course.


I don’t remember the exact carry on the bunkers left, but if you’re a bigger hitter, it’s best to fly those. Leaving it out to the right leaves quite a long shot into this green, and that’s something you don’t want.

One of the more benign greens at Shinne, if such a thing. It’s only partly raised up. Thankfully, it accepts low, running shots fairly easily (something most will have here).


After the long, dogleg left, a middle length par 4 swinging to the right awaits at the 4th. “Pump House” plays 409 yards with bunkering on the inside corner of the dogleg.


Flynn’s biggest strength, in my opinion, is taking basic architecture principals and flipping them on their head, and there’s potentially no better example than here. On the 4th, bunkering guards the inside corner. Basic architecture knowledge and strategy understanding would suggest keeping it closer to the inside corner, but the opposite is true. Flynn’s green contouring often dictate play, and here, the best play is to hit it to the outside corner for the best angle in.


The 5th is the first par 5 on the golf course. It’s probably a good idea to play this hole well–there’s only two 5’s!

“Montauk” is a brilliant 535 yard golf hole split in the middle by a sandy hollow covered in heather. Keeping it to the right lets the shorter hitters easier, while the left side is a bigger carry. Either side, you gotta make sure you pick your line properly!


As you can see, the front nine at Shinnecock, for the most part, is pretty flat. The land doesn’t seem too inspiring. However, upon further inspection, you see micro-undulations and little bumps that can make it incredibly difficult to hit the shots you need to. The 5th is a great example.

As you can see from the photo below, I picked the right fairway. It was a cold October morning!


The green on the 5th is insanity, with fall offs everywhere. We had a back right pin, and to our surprise, anything long or right is the wrong miss!


You can see that over the 5th green is not the best spot to me.


The 6th is a pretty difficult hole in general, but picking your line here is a difficult task with the sea of heather and sand in front of you. 456 yards, “pond” is not easy.


The namesake comes along on the approach. Unless you missed the fairway, the pond will almost never come into play. It’s some 50 yards short of the green–well out of play.


This is another great, dare I say all-world green complex. I won’t say too much, but hopefully my photo below allows you to see the genius of the shaping here!


The 7th is likely the most famous hole here. In the 2004 US Open, the USGA lost control of the golf course, and the 7th, “Redan”, was the main issue. They were watering the green in between groups because balls wouldn’t stay on the green! That’s how severe this slope is.

But anyways, as we stepped up, our caddy told us “Redan” is french for double bogey, or something. At 189 yards, you wouldn’t expect double bogeys to come as easy as they do here! But I wouldn’t know, I made 2 (yes, this is a brag–please DM Thegolfingcanuck on Instagram about it).


In terms of the “redan” template, I don’t know if this is the best rendition. Actually, I think many people turn to next door at National Golf Links of America as a good example. The biggest issue with calling this “redan” is the ground game isn’t really encouraged like all the best redans. Typically, the best redans allow the bail out short right to let the natural movement of the land guide the ball in. However, here, that’s not happening as anything short collects at the bottom.


So that leaves you flying the shot onto the green, which is impossible. There’s only about a 7 x 7 square of area on the front portion of the green you can land it on that it will stay on the green. I wish I would’ve hit mine better to see, but the tilt on this is pure madness. Take a look below.


What’s even crazier is this might be the easiest par 3 here!

This is the best advice I will ever give. If you have a birdie in you, consider making it on the 8th hole. At 394 yards, it’s one of the shorter par 4’s at Shinne.


It still requires quite a good short iron in, but it’s the flattest hole here (wonderfully named “lowlands”). A massive false front and after that it runs hard to the back is all you need to negotiate with.


I say made a birdie on 8 because you’re now into a difficult three hole stretch. Upon writing this, the 9th, “Ben Nevis”, starts the best three hole stretch I’ve seen.


A 438 yard par 4, this hole moves to the left working back up to the base of the clubhouse. You start getting into much more undulating topography as well, giving a ton of wonky lies in the fairway.

With a long or mid iron in (you will have more club in that you’d think for a 440 par 4), it is as intimidating as anything. Playing up to the top, you have to hoist a club up to have any chance.


Thankfully, the green bowls in from the right. If you need to miss one, miss it right or long, but not too right as it’ll be in the mens locker room.


But don’t miss short.


To get a sense of the scale here, below is the view of the 9th green from the 18th.


The 9th is a great hole, but my vote for the best hole at Shinnecock is the 415 yard par 4, 10th “Eastward Ho.” Playing over the topography, it’s a blind tee shot.


The land is incredibly severe over the ridge that you will almost definitely have a messed up stance. Compounding that with the shot that awaits, it becomes an incredible approach shot. This is in my upper tier of favorite holes ever.


With the green site cut on the other side of the depression, anything short runs back about 60 yards. Below is a view from where each ball would collect (thankfully, I didn’t hit it here).


Anything long isn’t much better either, but at least you’re chipping back into the upslope (oh yeah, this green runs away from you at about 3% or 4%).


Looking back, you can see the roller coaster topography that lies in the fairway. It’s a rare hole where you can’t overpower it. With driver, you likely will have an awkward flip wedge in because the ball would run down forever. With restraint off the tee, you have a full club in (a good thing).


To finish off the all-world three hole stretch, we arrive at what has been dubbed the “shortest par 5 in golf.” In reality, “Hill Head,” the 159 yard par 3, 11th, is just an incredibly difficult par 3 up the hill.


It’s like hitting onto a tabletop. There’s very little square footage here.


Anything long and left is absolutely dead chipping back downhill. This is where I hit it, but I made a “birdie” 4 on this par 5 (doesn’t count? Really?). I was happy with a 4 here after missing it in the one spot you have to avoid.

The 12th is another excellent hole. In reality, there’s not a weak hole here (obviously). The back, however, continues to deliver all-world after all-world holes. 469 yards, “Tuckahoe” plays over Tuckahoe Road.


Shinnecock isn’t exactly the most difficult driving course in the world. As you can see, there’s a fair amount of width out here. The green complexes hold up extremely well, and the 12th is again difficult. In similar fashion to the 3rd, it rises ever-so-slightly and then falls back away from the player, but there’s ample room to hit a long iron in here.


The 13th is the shortest par 4 on the course at 374 yards. The hole moves pretty hard to the right around bunkering, but again, keeping it out to the outside corner on the left allows you to be hitting shots directly into the slope to control where the ball ends up as much as possible.


For those who remember, this is the hole where Phil Mickelson decided to hit a moving ball before it rolled down the mega false front.


The 14th, “Thoms Elbow,” is another great–no, all world–hole. 463 yards, it plays through some wonderful rolling land.


The approach shot plays uphill to a green that moves to the middle. It’s one of the rare holes here–with 9–that collects shots instead of repelling them.


A closer look at the green complex. It’s almost a saddle style green, with the two outside pin positions are higher than the middle portion.


The 15th is another wonderful mid length par 4. Playing down into the valley the front nine mainly occupied, it’s a good tee shot to let one go.


No doubt, it’s a well guarded green complex. Another one that runs away from you, it’s a rare forced golf shot that needs to be played high in the air. The beauty of Shinnecock is yes, the greens run away from you, but you’re often thinking of finding the false front to bump it into. You’re really not thinking about the aerial game outside of 7, 9, 10, 11, and 15. Everything else I found myself flighting shots in.


The 16th makes the trek back towards the clubhouse. The second par 5 on the golf course, “Shinnecock” is a 540 yard three shotter.


After you get the ball in play off the tee, the layup can be quite difficult. There’s quite a few bunkers on this hole alone, so navigating them is a challenge.


The green complex is pitched hard off the left, naturally falling to the low point of the property (3 fairway) and away from the high portion (11 green/12 tee). It is a splendid par 5.


The 17th is the final par 3 on the course at 180 yards. Interestingly titled “Eden,” this plays nothing like an eden template.


Ironically, it almost plays as a redan, with the green moving down and to the left. I don’t think it is, but it’s much closer to a redan than an eden! You can get a grasp of the green complex below.


The 18th is another outstanding, difficult par 4. Doglegging to the left, like 9, it avoids the cliche uphill par 4 finisher at the base of the clubhouse.


For the big hitters, the line is just to left of the caddies over the bunker. For the shorter hitters, playing out right is the play. With some undulating topography yet again complicating things, it’s a tough finisher at 426 yards. A bunker left, two short, and one right await players. The green complex has some of the wackiest, wild, and unpredictable movement anywhere. It makes for a ton of fun. If that pin is back-left, you’d have to hit it out right. If it’s on the right side, cutting the corner is the play. A wonderful hole to end.


Hard to say anything new about Shinnecock, but it blew my expectations away still. The beauty of Flynn’s architecture here is it’s a model you could adapt. Fallaway greens are rare in modern architecture, yet they shouldn’t be. They remain entirely playable, while being difficult enough to challenge the worlds best. Shinnecock Hills is a wonderful case study on how difficult short grass and angles can be.

Is it the worlds best? Hard to say so early. The only course I’ve played that would be close to Shinne in quality is Merion Golf Club’s East course. If someone told me the best course in the world was Shinnecock Hills, I would be able to see it fairly easily. An absolute bucket list course that I’ll be dreaming about throughout social distancing! (this last sentence will age well)."
6,Shinnecock Hills,top100,"Southampton, NY",William Flynn,1931,SHINNECOCK HILLS GOLF CLUB - 19 POINTS,David Jones,rev06_shinnecock_2,"Shinnecock Hills may just be the best golf course I’ve ever played. When you are playing a top 10 course in the world expectations are generally pretty high and there can be a little something which just makes you question how close to perfection it really is. Royal County Down had too many blind shots for me, National Golf Links was maybe a little too quirky. No such worries at Shinnecock – this was simply amazing on pretty much every level.

The course is hosting the US Open in 2018 and they have been doing a huge amount of work to prepare for it.  We played in September 2016 and the fairways had been sanded, according to our caddies this was pretty much business as usual at the moment – they are trying to get the course playing faster than ever in 2018. Sand was being injected into the fairways on a regular basis to get the course running firm and fast.

Coore and Crenshaw have been working on the course and they had also widened the fairways, there really wasn’t a huge amount of intimidation from the tees, and increased the greens by around 30%. This doesn’t actually increase the ‘playable’ area of the greens as the false fronts and run offs are significant but visually it is stunning. Since then we know some of the fairways have been tightened as the USGA worry about the course being over-run but hopefully that hasn't changed things too much.

The club itself is one of the oldest and most prestigious in the world, and it knows it! The welcome we received was pleasant enough but quite formal and this is a place which is serious about its golf. There is no sense that you are a ‘member for a day’ a la North Berwick. Oh no, you are honoured to be getting the chance to tee it up here. It’s well worth making sure you spend some time in the clubhouse looking at the letters and artefacts on the walls. 

While the inside of this clubhouse is great it’s actually the outside which has the real wow factor. It is said to be the oldest clubhouse in the USA and has a real simplicity to the design, perched on a hill and you can see through from one side through to the other.

The driving range is right up there with the best and there are plenty of opportunities to blow your money in the well-stocked pro shop, again though the welcome was cordial rather than effusive. The locker room is fairly straightforward but there are some nice touches. The membership list is up on the notice board with handicaps of all the members and there are some pretty illustrious names posted.

So we made our way to the first tee with two caddies in toe, one of whom had been working at the club for over 30 years and caddied for Bill Clinton, Tiger Woods and Jack Nicklaus here over the years so safe to say we were in good hands. 

We played from the medal tees where it’s a par 70 and the course measured just over 6,300 yards. Given the run on the ball and the width of the fairways it didn’t feel that this was a course you needed to try to overpower and while the longer hitters in the group had some advantage it was playable for all. The tees were really cleverly placed for us because it felt like we were playing the same approach shots in that the pros will in many cases without having to pound it 300+ from the tee.

However, we saw some of the new tees they were putting in for the US Open and they are going to take this course back a long way. It’ll be interesting to see just how long the course will measure then but given the fast running fairways it's understandably I think on balance that they have had to tighten it up in some areas as they need to do something to defend it, beyond the devilish greens.

There has been quite a lot of work done over recent years to bring in the current ‘in’ look on golf courses. You know the type - waste areas, natural edges to green, tee boxes which seem to just be plonked down on the ground. Coore and Crenshaw have been allowed to work their magic in places and it really does look fantastic.

I’m not going to go through a hole by hole analysis of the course but I would strongly urge you to look at this post on GolfClubatlas.com if that is what you are looking for. It is a fantastic description of the course.
Shinnecock Hills Golf COurse
What I will say is that this is a course which has no weak hole. Every single one gives adds to the experience of the course. This is definitely a course that is ‘all before you’. On almost every tee box you can see what is ahead, often from a slightly elevated position. There are a lot of doglegs, with more left to right, although as a drawer of the ball I didn’t feel unduly penalised.

The course most definitely has a proper links feel to it – the ball runs fast and the greens are hard to hold and often exposed to the wind. However, you cannot run the ball up to the greens in many cases as you could at a traditional British links. This is one of the main things that I found about US ‘links-style’ courses, they played harder than their UK counterparts often for this very reason.

The two nines both return to the wonderful clubhouse but this isn’t the kind of place where you pause for too much thought at the turn, given the fun you will could having you won’t really want to. The 10th is the only blind tee shot on the course before the brilliant short 11th greets you. Famed from the exploits of the 2004 US Open this really is a tough, tough par 3. Your caddie will mention more than once that it is the shortest par 5 in the world and my scorecard would support that view!

This is a course that you just don’t want to end, and when you walk off you will know that you have just enjoyed something very special. But it is playable - this isn’t a course which will chew you up and spit you out. Sure it’s a challenge and you will find it hard to play to your handicap but there doesn’t need to be any fear on the 1st tee box - at least not from the tees we played from with little wind and greens that hadn’t been mown to the quick. I guess 2018 will show us just what a test this will give to the best in the world, but I suspect they will find this course at its peak and the reports will be nothing short of adulatory. It definitely deserves it.

BOOKING THE COURSE
Shinnecock Hills sorecard
Sigh. I’m sorry but these American courses do make it very hard. At Shinnecock though there are a few glimmers. They do accept unaccompanied guest play if you can find a member to introduce you - Pine Valley and Merion for example don’t so this makes it marginally easier to get on - however you do need to find that member and there aren’t that many of them. Therefore, if you are really keen to get on then the best route may well be to look out for charity auctions again. In the last few months I have seen 2 or 3 on Charitybuzz.com and if you set up a Google alert service you should get to find out whenever something is available. They are few and far between though and it may set you into the thousands of dollars which is a lot to pay for a round of golf, even on one of the very best courses in the world.

TOUR TIPS

I have been to this part of the world a couple of times for golf and both times stayed in the town of Riverhead - about 20 minutes from Shinnecock Hills. We stayed in the Indigo hotel the first time - just a little out of town - and the Hyatt in the middle of things the second time.  Both were absolutely fine, the Hyatt would probably get my vote next time as it was an easy walk from here to the sights and sounds of Riverhead. OK, those sights and sounds won't take you too long to explore but there were plenty of good eating options. Jeremy and the Mermaid was right next door and had good seafood at a reasonable price while the Riverhead Diner and Grill will leave you pretty full. There are plenty of well-priced pubs in town too so Riverhead is a pretty good base all round. If you fancy a 10 minute drive to the north I would recommend Cooperage Inn as a good venue for a nice meal and good service.

While this area is perfectly hospitable, Manhattan it isn't. But let's face it, you will be here for the golf. Shinnecock in a must play if you can but if you add in the likes of  National Golf Links of America, Friar's Head and Sebonack then you have an amazingly high quality golf trip which you will never forget."
7,National Golf Links of America,top100,"Southampton, NY",C.B. Macdonald,1911,NATIONAL GOLF LINKS OF AMERICA - 18 POINTS,David Jones,rev07_national_america_1,"There are bucket golf courses which everyone has heard of, courses like Augusta, St Andrews, Pebble Beach. Then there are the courses which many are familiar from great US Opens and Ryder Cups - courses like Shinnecock, Merion and Winged Foot. But then there are courses which many will not have heard of by many average golfers but are simply amongst the very best in the world. Pine Valley would be a great example of this and the National Golf Links of America is another.

NGLA, or The National, is set on the north side of Long Island, adjacent to both the classic of Shinnecock Hills and the new pretender of Sebonack. The course is deemed one of the true classics of architectural design. CB Macdonald was the man with the vision to put together a collection of some of the greatest holes from the UK on this wonderful links land overlook Peconic Bay.  

Following several years visiting the best that the UK has to offer, Macdonald returned to the US and copied many of the best holes he had seen, as well as some originals, to produce the National.

In terms of that idea I think that it would be true to say that these holes are more 'inspired by' the originals rather than real copies. You wouldn't necessarily stand on the tees and call the holes they are copied from in all cases - although the Redan fourth is a pretty good effort!

This course has a more members feel to it than some of the new courses in the area like Friar's Head and Sebonack. The locker rooms were wonderfully old school - there was an exotic array of painkillers available to get you through the round, powders to cover all conditions and an honesty box for cigars and playing cards by the door.  

There were a couple of members ahead of us so we went out to the range. Inspired maybe by the UK links ranges there was nothing special here. No island greens to aim to - just a nice big field. We had no complaints at all and the setting by the dunes and the beach was great. Here's a little video to show you what it was all about.

The driving range facilities at The National

The practice green indicated that there was going to be a good speed to the greens and running very true and after a few nerve-racking putts we went to the first tee.

A word before going on about the caddies. We had a gentleman named Threewood carrying for two of us and a younger caddie taking the other two bags. Threewood has been caddying here for 10 years and caddied for Matt Fitzpatrick in the Walker Cup. The caddies get to play the course 4 days a week - what an amazing perk.  

Billy the caddie master displays a cup in his desk by the first tee which is awarded to the winner of the annual caddy competition between National and the next door Shinecock. NGLA have won 19 of the last 20 events, something they were very proud of! Threewood is a stalwart of the team and proved to be a great caddie, his reads on the green were wonderful and did his best to keep us out of trouble.
The National Golf Links of America has a famous windmill landwark
I will not attempt to describe it hole by hole - this article on Golf Club Atlas does a great job of that. What I will say is that the course does quirkiness to quite an extreme level. You get a feel of that from the very first hole with just a rescue needed down to a dell before wedging up to a very well guarded green which has massive ridges and slopes on. The second is then modelled after the fourth at Royal St George’s which if you manage a longish carry then gives you the benefit of a run down to a very driveable green for the longer hitter. My opponent got a really close up look at the windmill as his Pro V1 struck it smack full on!

The holes are really memorable and will stay with you for a long time. The Redan hole that comes at the fourth is definitely a worthy copy of the 15th at North Berwick. I think it plays a little easier as there is a bigger layup area short right at National but the bunker short left is probably more penal.

This is the kind of course which you know if you played a second time you would score better, there are so many trap to fall into - quite literally in the case of the 'Road Hole' bunker short on the hole styled after the 17th at St Andrews.

Do make sure you take the time to enjoy some ginger snaps and cheese spread at the halfway house before taking on the bank 9. You will need plenty of energy for the challenge ahead. 10, 11 and 12 are all incredibly tough pars 4s. The wind had turned after 9 so we played the whole course pretty much into the wind and these holes were a real challenge. The last holes are probably the strongest part of the course.  

After the par 3 Eden on 13 (modelled after 11 at St Andrews) you turn for home, using the windmill as a guide all the way up to the 17th tee. These holes don't require massive length off the tee to get home but do require the right line in to avoid very well guarded greens.  

The 16th 'Punchbowl' is great fun with everything around the green funnelling the ball towards the hole and the view from the 17th tee shot is breathtaking. This hole requires a long an accurate tee shot before a precision wedge into a green surrounded by sand. It was a nice place to get my first birdie of the round.

The 18th is the only hole on the course really next to the water, a par 5 which played a good three shorter into the wind despite being under 500 yards.

The course was a delight to play. I had expected this to be something special, given it's top 10 in the world ranking and I think it pretty much delivered. The only thing I would say is that in places it felt a little too quirky. Several times I found myself in lies where I was standing a over the ball in a tiny bunker which was incredibly hard to play and while I totally accept they are hazards they did try the patience a little!  

The condition of the course was just excellent and this is probably one of the highest ‘18’ rated course I have played, I just can't quite tip it into 19 territory - maybe my next visit will change that! You can see where it sits in my all-time rankings here.
The lobster 'amuse bouche' at NGLA has to be seen to be believed!
The course at the National is only half the story. The clubhouse is something of a national treasure too with a huge amount of memorabilia from the history not only of the National but of American golf. The drawing room has tables for a game of backgammon or draughts under the intimidating figure of CB MacDonald and make sure you spend time looking at some of the great pictures, cartoons and statues dotted around the place.

The ritual of lunch at the National is not to be missed if you get the chance. While you are deciding on your choices for starter and mains you are served a whole lobster, as an 'amuse bouche' which is quite something. Following that there will be a soup or other starter (the oysters were good) before having one of the traditional main courses such as cottage pie served with a healthy side of Mac and Cheese. Washed down with a Southside cocktail and bottle of very well priced Cloudy Bay wine it was quite a treat.

If truth be told I was expecting to leave the National with this as a shoe-in 19 but when I compared it to the great courses with that score I have come to the conclusion that it is just a touch behind. The course is just a little too quirky for me. Maybe if I played it a few times it would help me appreciate it all the more, but for now I will leave it at that. The lunch, well that was a 20!"
8,National Golf Links of America,top100,"Southampton, NY",C.B. Macdonald,1911,NATIONAL GOLF LINKS OF AMERICA REVIEW,Graylyl Loomis,rev08_national_america_2,"National Golf Links of America was the last round to fall into place during the New York trip. Whenever I mentioned that I would be playing the course to friends ahead of the round, they all said the same thing, “You won’t find another course like National anywhere else! You’ll love it.” Quirky, fun, and unique were the words that kept coming up, and my excitement for the day steadily grew, especially as we played Shinnecock the day before and peeked through the trees over to National.


The course was designed by C.B. Macdonald and it remains relatively unchanged from its original layout. National Golf Links has never had the pressure to adapt the course for professional tournaments, since it has never hosted a US Open or the like. The only major changes were a new set of tees added for a recent Walker Cup. Although we didn’t play those tees, a friend who has says they elevate the course to an even higher level. Like many MacDonald courses, the layout is comprised of template holes from Scotland. However, at National, they seem to fit the landscape better than nearly anywhere else in the US. National Golf Links of America was formed in 1908 and the Macdonald course opened three years later in 1911. 


The round at National Golf Links of America started early in the day. We drove through the imposing gates, changed shoes in the classic and understated locker room, and made our way to the range. The range borders Peconic Bay down the entire left side, which made for a distractingly good view… We met our member host on the range, struck a few more shots, and made our way to the first tee.


Right off the bat I had trouble finding my rhythm at National. I thought I had hit a good drive on the first, but it was too far left, so I lost the ball. I hit my provisional on target down the right, but it went through the fairway, leading to another lost ball in the rough. Two balls lost on the first tee… The tee shot is blind on the 2nd hole and the approach shot is blind on the 3rd. I finally began to settle into the round by the 4th hole. The start reminded me of so many Scottish links that make you think, “I will play that so differently next time!” There is a lot of local knowledge at National, and despite having caddies, they can only help so much when they don’t know your game or distances off the tee. Like so many of the great Scottish links, your strategy and understanding of National would evolve and deepen over time.


I wasn’t able to take as many photos as usual at National, so instead of my typical hole-by-hole review, I want to touch on my favorite points (which are numerous…).

Hole #4 – 181 yards – “Redan” – Similar to the original at North Berwick, this hole slopes from right to left and has a series of bunkers guarding the front. The angle is slightly different than the original, but it may be the closest replica that I’ve seen. As with many other Redans, the margin for error is small on this tough one shot hole.

Hole #6 – 123 yards – “Short” – This was one of my favorite greens on the course. It is massive, and depending on the pin position, it could play in an infinite number of different ways. The front right pin made the effective size of the green much smaller. We aimed about 15 feet left of the pin where a slope carries the ball to the right. The green is very undulating, so make sure you hit to the correct area.

Hole #7 – 467 yards – “St Andrews” – How am I not going to like a hole that is modeled off of one at St Andrews?! The blind tee shot isn’t pictured below, but the approach to the green looks innocuous enough… right? Well, there is a massive bunker behind the green the requires staircases to descend. The bunker on the left – the Road Hole bunker – is almost as deep as Pine Valley’s Devil’s Asshole. It’s not easy.

Hole #8 – 385 yards – “Bottle” – A group of small, narrow bunkers split the fairway down the left. Longer hitters can try to carry them up the left, but most players take it down the right. The green is raised with an intimidating group of bunkers short that collect mishits (see photos below).

Hole #11 – 418 yards – “Plateau” – This was yet another interesting green that marks one of the best back nines you will find in America. Drives end up short of the berm for most players, leaving a semi-blind shot into the green. Two well-placed bunkers prevent thoughtless approach shots. I ended up playing mine out left because of a bunker, even though I now realize I didn’t need to. Congrats, CB Macdonald. You beat me. Does anyone else see the similarities to the sharp mound in front of the fourth on the St Andrews Old Course?


Hole #13 – 159 yards – “Eden” – The Eden green is another nod to St Andrews (Old Course, 11th hole), which is most obviously seen in the bunker in the front center of the green. Distance control is important here, as you want to avoid those front bunkers, but don’t want to go long.
Hole #14 – 341 yards – “Cape” – This hole is a dogleg right with a drive over water. The smart play is a 220-yard shot out to the left, leaving a better angle into the green. A bunker runs down the entire right side of the hole, which is where I took the picture directly below. The second photo shows the small bunkers guarding the left side of the approach shot. 

Hole #15 – 368 yards – “Narrows” – The back nine at National Golf Links of America is special, but these final four raise the bar to another level. While this tee shot is fairly straightforward, the approach to the green isn’t easy. Any shot hit long can run over the green and into a lake behind it. Short shots roll back and a bunker collects shots leaked right. Aim center of the green and don’t miss!DSC00306DSC00307

Hole #16 – 394 yards – “Punchbowl” – Some of my favorite holes in golf are Punchbowls. In fact, the Course Reviews page on the site uses the Fishers Island Punchbowl for a background image. Well-struck drives can reach the top of this hill on the 16th, but the approach shot is blind no matter where you go. There is an aiming pole behind the green and bunkers short, so take plenty of club and hold the line.DSC00308DSC00313DSC00314

Hole #17 – 342 yards – “Peconic” – The 17th is one of the best views on the golf course. Bunkers down the left and in front of the green capture and misplaced tee shots. The best play is to hit a 220 shot running into the downhill fairway. If you click the photo below to enlarge it, you will see the entrance to National Golf Links just over the right side of this green. DSC00315
Hole #18 – 483 Yards – “Home” – This hole may seem short, but it plays straight uphill. Big hitters can carry the bunkers on the left side of the fairway, leaving a straightforward approach to the putting surface. It is a great birdie opportunity with a jawdropping view of Peconic Bay.

After the round we enjoyed lobster sandwiches and Arnold Palmers in the Birds Cage, which is the casual screened-in porch overlooking the 18th hole. If the view from Shinnecock’s back porch is the ultimate golf course view, neighboring National Golf Links must have the ultimate water view. You could happily spend all afternoon there soaking in the atmosphere and wondering how you ended up lucky enough to play the course!


I was amazed at how different Shinnecock and National Golf Links are. The two courses border one another, but they couldn’t have been more different. Shinnecock’s layout is right in front of you, while National’s blind shots and hidden features mean you would notice more each round. There are a multitude of different ways to play each hole at National, and like links courses in Scotland, you stand on each green and look back thinking, “Next time I will play this hole differently…” I completely understand why people love NGLA so much and I hope I am able to return one day to peel back the next layer of genius."

Individual Hole Analysis
Signature Hole:  18th Hole – 484 Yard Par 4 – The picturesque 18th hole at Oakmont has long been touted as one of the best inland finishing holes in America. Five bunkers lie in wait of any tee shot that isn't striped down the middle of the short grass. The longish approach shot plays to a green that is protected by a series of four small bunkers on the left and a larger bunker on the right. The finishing hole typifies the entire course; a tough but fair hole that will reward good shots and make bad shots look even worse. Lastly, the clubhouse at Oakmont is as signature as any feature found at the club. The walls are covered with photos, trophys, scorecards, and other memorabilia that only an eight time host of the U.S. Open could sport.

18th Hole at Oakmont Country Club (484 Yard Par 4)
Best Par 3:  6th Hole – 194 Yards – The par threes at Oakmont aren't flashy, they are just solid. What makes this hole great is that the distance is pretty easy to handle, but the slope from right to left on the incredibly fast green makes hitting the middle or left side of the green imperative. A pin in the back right corner is just flat out mean since balls can come rolling back to the middle of the green while a chip shot from the right side of the green has zero chance of finishing close to the hole.

6th Hole at Oakmont Country Club (194 Yard Par 3)
Best Par 4:  3rd Hole – 478 Yards – Church pews - enough said. OK, I'll say more. The iconic 12 row church pew bunkers represent the most recognizable sand and fescue complex in America. Not only are the church pew bunkers cool to look at, but the are extremely penal. Avoid those bunkers and you'll still be faced with an uphill approach shot to a semi-blind green.

3rd Hole at Oakmont Country Club (478 Yard Par 4)
Best Par 5:  4th Hole – 609 Yards – While the 3rd hole assumes the reputation of the church pew bunkers, you aren't done with them until you play down the 4th hole where you will again find them resting on your left. This downhill par five is reachable in two despite the 609 yard distance it plays due to the firmness of the fairways and how much this hole ends up playing downhill. If you can avoid the church pew bunkers and the addtional 16 other bunkers on this hole then there is a good chance to put a four on your scorecard.

4th Hole at Oakmont Country Club (609 Yard Par 5)
Birdie Time:  14th Hole – 358 Yard Par 4 – The short 14th hole features a series of wide but short bunkers up the right side of this hole and five more bunkers up the left side. It seems clear that the architect is trying to force the golfer into putting away his driver, but doesn't eliminate the option all together. The green is the second largest on the course and with a wedge or short iron in your hand for your approach shot your should have a great chance of knocking in a birdie.

14th Hole at Oakmont Country Club (358 Yard Par 4)
Bogey Beware:  8th Hole – 288 Yard Par 3 – Most avid golfers are familiar with the term of 1/2 par holes, however the 8th at Oakmont is worthy of a new classification called the 3 3/4 par. At 288 yards with a 100 yard long bunker up the left side, most players will score a bogey three out of four times. The longest par three in major championship history, the 8th hole is a big, tough, brute of a hole and one of the few times you'll need to tee up your driver to reach the green.

10,Oakmont,top100,"Oakmont, PA",Henry Fownes,1903,OAKMONT COUNTRY CLUB REVIEW,Graylyl Loomis,rev010_oakmont_2,"The journey of playing top golf courses around the world takes you down unexpected roads. I was sitting at my desk at LINKS Magazine when an email came into my inbox. It was from the USGA and it offered the chance to play Oakmont in the 2016 US Open Media Day. The only problem was that it was a Tuesday, and the media day was less than a week away. I immediately booked a flight with my boss at LINKS and we started planning a last minute trip to Pittsburgh!

The funny thing is, I’ve been planning a Pennsylvania golf trip for this coming August. We have a round booked at Merion and Oakmont is a possible round on that trip. The thought crossed my mind to hold off and wait to play the course in August, but like they say, “a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush.”

Because it was the USGA Media Day, we attended a short presentation from a number of Oakmont and USGA brass before lunch in the clubhouse and an afternoon round. One of the most interesting speeches came from Mike Davis, the President of the USGA. He said that Oakmont was one of the only courses in the states that could host a US Open with two weeks notice. The course stays in championship condition throughout the season. Among many other things, he said that the normal course rating at Oakmont is 77 from the tips, but the course rating is close to 82 come US Open week… let that sink in while you gain even more appreciation for Johnny Miller’s 63 back in the day (and remember it’s a par 70)!

Oakmont was founded by Henry C. Fownes. He was a steel man who sold his business to Andrew Carnegie. Carnegie got him into golf, and Fownes proceeded to find land just outside of Pittsburgh to build a course of his own. Like many of the great course founders/designers, it was his “one hit wonder,” and he settled into a penal mindset with the design. Henry and his son William, who followed his father as club president, added bunkers, sped up the greens, and did everything in their power to make golf at Oakmont hard. William Fowne’s famous quote, “a poor shot should be a shot irrevocably lost” sums up the Fownes’ mindset very well.

I was told before the round that Oakmont was incredibly difficult. I’ve played very difficult courses before, but Oakmont was different. There was literally no margin for error. Combine that with having never seen the course before and it was all made tougher. My caddie would say, “Hit this down the left side of the fairway.” I would proceed to hit a well-struck drive down the middle, just right of target, and we would find it in the thick right rough. The greens speeds were some of the fastest I’ve ever seen, which made the short game exponentially harder. The player with a great caddie and tons of course knowledge will do well this June in the US Open.

My only “negative” comment about the club addresses something outside of their control. The Pennsylvania Turnpike runs right through the middle of the course. Crossing the bridges twice during the round isn’t tough, and the interstate is sunk into the ground, so it’s not even visible from much of the course. My complaint has to do with the noise. It is constant on much of the course. It isn’t a huge negative, but it means that Oakmont lacks that “sanctuary” feel that is present at many of the other truly great courses.

Hole #1 – 441 yards – Big drives will catch a downhill slope, leaving a wedge into the sloping green. Approach shots run hard left once on the putting surface.

Hole #2 – 325 yards – Long irons or hybrids land in the widest part of the fairway and leave short irons into the green. The dry creek bed along the left edge of the fairway is marked as hazard, but you can pitch out in dry conditions.

Hole #3 – 390 yards – Yes, those are the Church Pews along the left side! Don’t be short on this green and just as important, don’t be long. Balls run over this green easily into a difficult collection area (as I found).

Hole #4 – 512 yards – Although it isn’t mentioned much, the Church pews are in play again on the 4th hole. The blind layup and subsequent approach to the narrow green make it extraordinarily difficult.

Hole #5 – 349 yards – Favor the right side of the fairway on this blind tee shot. The short approach to the small and undulating green will be a fun one to watch during the US Open.

Hole #6 – 168 yards – One of the course changes since 2007 was flattening an area of this green to create more pin placement options… and it’s still extreme!

Hole #7 – 370 yards – The fairway is fairly wide for this blind approach, but the bunkers and deep rough surrounding the green are no joke.

Hole #8 – 225 yards – This is the legendary 300 yard par 3. It played about 235 during our round, but the large open front of the green allows for running approaches.

Hole #9 – 462 yards – The 9th plays back up to the clubhouse and a massive green. The rear of the putting surface doubles as the practice putting green. The distance on this hole may seem short for a par 5, but it plays uphill the whole way.

Hole #10 – 440 yards – While the 9th played longer uphill, the 10th plays shorter back down the hill. It narrows substantially closer to the green, so bigger hitters can just play a 3-wood down the right side of the fairway.

Hole #11 – 328 yards – Back up the hill again! Drivers aren’t necessary here for longer hitters, especially since a driver could reach the creek.

Hole #12 – 562 yards – This tee shot begs for a smashed cut that runs downhill and right on the sloping fairway. This is a birdie opportunity.

Hole #13 – 153 yards – Although the green is sloping, this is one of the easiest holes on the course. It should reflect that in US Open scoring.

Hole #14 – 340 yards – Difficult bunkers line both sides of this fairway, which narrows closer to the green.

Hole #15 – 434 yards – The tough finish begins here. The approach shot is blind, and penal Church Pew bunkers line the left side of this fairway (Did you know there is more than one set of Church Pews at Oakmont?).
Hole #16 – 211 yards – This hole is a beast. The bail out is left, but that leaves a very long put across the green to a back pin (click to enlarge the photo and look at the back right pin).

Hole #17 – 296 yards – This hole can make or break someone’s tournament (or round in the amateur’s case). Smart money plays a short shot up the right side and wedge into the green, but bold players can go for the green. See the small red flag in the distance? Also, don’t end up in any of the bunkers around the green.

Hole #18 – 430 yards – It all ends with a picturesque hole back to the clubhouse. The fairway bunkers on the right are very much in play. Most difficult of all is the sloping green – DON’T be above the hole.
Oakmont Country Club exudes history, tradition, and beauty. The clubhouse and locker room are on-par with some of my favorites. The course is extremely difficult, and frankly, it would be discouraging to play when struggling with your game. That being said, I’m sure it’s a fun feeling to shoot mid 80s at Oakmont before you go bust a 70 at any typical golf course around the country!2"
11,Sand Hills,top100,"Mullen, NE",Bill Coore/Ben Crenshaw,1995,Sand Hills Golf Club: The Club TFE Profile,Andy Johnson,rev011_sand_hill_1,"In 1995, in the remote Sandhills of Nebraska, Bill Coore and Ben Crenshaw changed the trajectory of golf course architecture. Sand Hills Golf Club proved that a faraway course on spectacular land could work. It was a “field of dreams” moment for the golf industry, which had been focused for decades on building in population centers. Developer Dick Youngscap deserves immense credit for pushing the crazy idea of taking golf to the small town of Mullen, four-plus hours away from any major airport.

Take note…

Sand Hills was built on a shoestring budget. Coore & Crenshaw did very little earthmoving. The only green that required a considerable shaping effort was the par-4 fourth green, which benches into the big sand dune and falls off hard on the right side.
In its original form, the 12th hole did not have a green-side bunker. That was added one year after opening to enhance the strategy of the hole.
On many properties, creating 18 holes is a challenge. At Sand Hills, the challenge was figuring out which 18 holes to use. Near a staircase in the clubhouse is a constellation map of holes from Coore & Crenshaw’s many routing ideas and efforts. It shows the over 130 potential golf holes in and around the valley where the current course resides.
Favorite hole

No. 2, par 4, 284-458 yards I’m a sucker for great holes early in the round, but there are a few other reasons why I love the second at Sand Hills:
Restraint – On a site where there are natural spots for bunkers everywhere you turn, the second hole has only one in play, and it’s there more to deceive golfers than to gobble up golf balls.
Green site – The most memorable moment from my first visit to Sand Hills was climbing the hill on the second hole and walking toward the green. The horizon line formed by the back of the green is all you see, and you feel like you’re approaching the edge of the world. Once you see the endless sand dunes in the distance, you get a sense for the magnitude of the locale. This view gives a context for the rest of the round.
Green contours – This is one of the most undulating greens on the course, and it’s really fun to hit shots into it. The ball will tend to funnel to pins on the left and be deflected from pins on the right. Both sides are exciting in different ways.
Overall thoughts

This is one of the greatest courses in the world. There’s so much to marvel at as you walk it. Two aspects of Sand Hills that stick with me most are how well the course embodies its place and how thoroughly worked out the strategic concepts of the holes are. I can’t think of any other club I’ve been to that has such a distinct feel and culture. These traits are shaped by the town of Mullen more than the membership itself, and much of the credit for that dynamic belongs to the club’s visionary, Dick Youngscap, who empowered the local staff to be culture setters. Sand Hills is unapologetically unique and its own. It’s not trying to be anywhere or anything else. Almost everyone treks long distances to get there, and the emphasis is on one thing: the golf. The accommodations are spartan, the food is outstanding but simple, the people are incredibly nice, and the golf is world-class. Part of what this course and its culture prove is that luxurious accommodations and amenities aren’t necessary. What is necessary is an outstanding course and a strong community looking after it. It’s easy to see that Mike Keiser learned something from the culture of Sand Hills and applied it to Bandon Dunes. If you’re curious what Sand Hills is like, imagine a more intimate and remote Bandon Dunes with slightly less stellar accommodations. Now on to the golf course itself. Every hole at Sand Hills has preferred lines. These can change day to day based on different hole locations and winds. Coore & Crenshaw were working with a tremendous place for strategic golf, as the natural elements are off the charts. The wind, dry conditions, and sandy soil make everything come alive. Coore & Crenshaw found strategy in a variety of ways: natural terrain, green contours, devastating hazards. Generally—and wisely—they opted for natural topography rather than artificial bunkering in many spots. Sand Hills is a great example of how the best architects are often the ones confident enough to leave a piece of ground alone and know that the topography will do the work for them. I don’t believe it would be possible for a serious golfer to play Sand Hills a few times and come away without at least a basic understanding of how golf strategy works. Along with the 18th hole, which we’ve already written about, the 14th is maybe the course’s clearest example of strategic design. This reachable par 5 offers an advantage to playing up the left because the green, the smallest on the property, is angled to accept shots from that side. Furthermore, the left half of the fairway offers the chance to catch a massive downslope into a big hollow, which will add 60-plus yards to a tee shot. The problem is, playing left is a risk because a massive blowout bunker sits there. Finding this bunker will eliminate almost all hope for a birdie and make for a challenging par. Hitting a long tee shot up the right is fine, but it leaves a difficult second shot, with a bunker short, a bunker long, and about 10 yards of green to work with. Even a layup is tricky. There’s plenty of room to the right, short of the green-fronting bunker, but it’s a nervy pitch from there. To lay up left, you have to contend with another massive blowout. Almost every hole at Sand Hills puts players in this position—take the risk right now or pass it off to the next shot.

If I were to critique two things about Sand Hills, I’d focus on the 13th hole and the lack of a walking culture. The par-3 13th is breathtaking; I’m just not sure it sets a consistently achievable task. Perhaps it’s yet another victim of increased green speeds, but the margin for holding any part of this green is very slim. As for the walking piece, I’ve been disappointed with how much cart golf at Sand Hills, which is such a wonderful—if hilly—place to walk. To be fair, the Sand Hills membership is on the older side, and most members go there to play golf all day. But I still wish more decided to walk and truly take in one of the cathedrals of the game. Sand Hills changed golf architecture. It’s a course that should be visited and studied by anyone interested in golf architecture as a profession. And keep in mind that for average joes, Sand Hills is attainable. A letter explaining why you want to experience the course may open up an opportunity for an afternoon round, an overnight stay, and a morning round. Not every letter is answered, but some requests are granted. It’s certainly worth a try. -AJ
Egg score: 3 Eggs

Sand Hills is everything a three-Egg course should be. The land is unique, beautiful, and perfect for golf. The design matches it, as we discussed earlier. It’s varied and strategic, and accommodates a wide variety of shots and skill levels. Superintendent Kyle Hegland does a marvelous job presenting the course, with the native vegetation deserving special praise. When you hit one out of play and into the taller grass, it’s usually easy to find your ball and feasible to get it back in the fairway. This is what well-maintained native does: it allows for the possibility of a heroic shot from an unpredictable lie. And that’s what you find at Sand Hills."
12,Sand Hills,top100,"Mullen, NE",Bill Coore/Ben Crenshaw,1995,Sand Hills Golf Club - Top 100 Golf Courses of the World,top100golfcourses,rev012_sand_hill_2,"The Sandhills region of Nebraska is a huge meadow, which extends to some 20,000 square miles but amidst the cowboys and the grazing cattle, lies a magnificent sandy tract of golfing ground, which is otherwise known as Sand Hills Golf Club.

Sand Hills Golf Club is a club to respect and those in the know admire their non-commerciality, which is a welcome break from tradition in these days of the perennial money-go-round. One hundred golf holes might easily have been laid out on this amazingly natural piece of land, but Bill Coore and Ben Crenshaw settled on just eighteen. But make no mistake, they discovered the best possible routing and each and every hole at Sand Hills is very special indeed.

The ""Golden Age of Architecture"" inspired Ben Crenshaw and Bill Coore to set up together sharing the philosophy that traditional, strategic golf is the most rewarding. And, when Sand Hills opened for play in 1995, they must have been quietly delighted with their achievement.

Sand Hills has only a few lucky members, and surely each and every one of them must belong to another golf club. Why? Because Sand Hills is closed for eight months each year… overplayed it is certainly not.

With wide, generous fairways that wind their way beside huge dunes, Sand Hills is a big course on a big scale and it’s tempting to open your shoulders. But beware of the sand. You will need to be either an extremely good golfer or a very lucky one to avoid the crater-like bunkers at Sand Hills Golf Club.

Darius Oliver had no doubt about the importance of Sand Hills his book Planet Golf USA, calling it “arguably the most important American golf course since Augusta National.” The author continued: “Its opening not only placed this remote and seemingly desolate region firmly on the golfing radar, but it almost single-handedly led to a rebirth in classic golf architecture in this country.

Although winds can whip through these Nebraska plains with great force, they don’t come from a prevailing direction, so the designers were careful to ensure their holes were playable under all conditions.

Fairways are sensibly spacious, while the target areas are mostly open to encourage chase-in approach shots. The diversity of the putting slopes is quite astonishing, as is the variety of the actual green locales, whether they be pitched in hollows, set atop plateau or built beside exposed sand dunes.”"

However, in 2012 I had the opportunity to attend a day of the Masters and regard it as one of the most enjoyable days of my life. Augusta National is a club like no other in the world and upholds the honors and traditions of the game with strict importance. Respect for members, club personnel, and the course is expected at all times; no exceptions. The course closes after Memorial Day and reopens in the fall upon the completion of any projects deemed necessary for the upcoming Masters. From what I hear, the experience at Augusta is unmatched. Video archives of the previous Masters are available to watch in the evenings when not on the course. Want to see Nick Faldo win the Master back-to-back in 1990 and 1991? Just ask, politely, and your wish will be granted. Want to relive Tiger's memorable twelve stroke victory? Not a problem. When playing at Augusta, a caddie will carry your clubs bag and help read greens as you stroll along the most immaculate and healthy turf in the world. There are only two sets of tees at the course (neither or which have slopes or ratings), the Members tee and the Masters tee, further confirming Augusta's mission and commitment to hosting the greatest golf tournament in the world. Simply put, Augusta National represents Bobby Jones' dream and is the holy grail of golf.

Individual Hole Analysis
Signature Hole:  12th Hole – 155 Yard Par 3 – One of the most famous holes in the world and the heart of Amen Corner! This gorgeous hole can be as treacherous as it is beautiful. With Rae's Creek fronting the green and a pair of bunkers to the rear, absolute precision is necessary to hit this green in regulation. Located at the corner of the property and bordered by majestic trees, the winds can get swirling in this portion of the course and cause havoc with club selection. With its extensive history and unmatched beauty, Augusta National's 12th hole ranks among the finest holes in golf.

Best Par 3:  16th Hole – 170 Yards – Redbud has yielded more aces during the Masters than any other hole at Augusta and is yet another beautiful offering. The green features a large pond to the left and three bunkers around the putting surface. A spine is the middle of the green feeds balls left which creates mega drama when the pin is placed on the left side of the green in the traditional Sunday placement. During practice rounds at the Masters this hole has become an entertainment spot where players intentionally skip their tee shot off the water and onto the green. One of the most memorable moments on this hole came in 2005 when Tiger Woods had missed the green to the left before chipping his approach up onto the putting surface only to see it hang on the edge of the cup for a moment before collapsing into the hole and propelling Tiger to victory.

Best Par 4:  10th Hole – 495 Yards – The large iconic bunker in the middle of the fairway on this long par four is the last remaining distinctive stamp that is left of Dr. MacKenzie's work. The attractive edging on the bunker is inspired by camouflage from Alister's days in the army and used to be much closer to the green. When Perry Maxwell reworked the hole in 1937 the green was pushed 50 yards back so that the sprawling bunker is now more of a visual intimidation than it is a hazard to contend with. The hole plays well downhill and setups up for some dramatic results, as has been the case in recent years as the 2nd playoff hole during the Masters. It was on this hole that Bubba Watson hooked his approach shot from the trees onto the green before two-putting to victory. Most recently, this is where Adam Scott converted a birdie putt to edge out Angel Cabrera to become the first Australian to earn the coveted green jacket. This hole was also the beginning of the end for a young Rory McIlroy that hooked his tee shot into the trees before taking a triple bogey and watching his Masters dream walk away. Love it or hate it, the 10th hole at Augusta is the pivotal beginning of golf's most famous back nine.

Best Par 5:  13th Hole – 510 Yards – Other than perhaps the 18th hole at Pebble Beach, no other par five in the world is more highly regarded than Augusta's famous 13th. Brilliant in design, the hole banks from right to left with the fairway sloping left towards Rae's Creek. With the ball above your feet and creating a natural draw, the green calls for a ball to fade into the putting surface over Rae's Creek while managing to avoid the hillside of bunkers to the rear. Tee balls that draw around the corner significantly reduce the yardage into the green yet ball that stay to the right, shy of the trees, setup for a great angle to the putting surface. Phil Mickelson's bold and miraculous approach shot from the pine straw on the upper right side of the hole in 2010 has become an iconic image in Masters fan's minds. One thing is for sure, this hole always plays an exciting roll in the final outcome Sunday afternoon at the Masters.

Birdie Time:  15th Hole – 530 Yard Par 5 – One of the things that makes Sunday afternoon at the Masters so exciting is the risk/reward nature of the reachable par fives. The 15th plays up to the crest of a hill where players are then greeted with a downhill view of the green completely fronted by a pond. A lone bunker sits to the right of the putting surface and the drop area off to the left. The green is twice as deep on the right side as the left and a pond rests well beyond the putting surface in the event an approach shot comes in too hot. If you can't reach the green in two, there is a flat area to layup to on the left side of the fairway which will setup a short chip and an excellent birdie opportunity. The most recent drama at this hole occurred Friday afternoon in the 2013 Masters when Tiger Wood's 3rd shot ricocheted off the flag and into the water. In a temporary mental lapse, Tiger took an illegal drop which originally was deemed legal. However, following his remarks in an interview after the round, the committee deemed the drop inappropriate and Tiger was assessed a two stroke penalty the next morning. In terms of birdie time, the hole played the most strokes under par in 2013 while yielding 16 eagles and 118 birdies compared to 143 pars.

Bogey Beware:  11th Hole – 505 Yard Par 4 – The beginning of Amen Corner, this par four measures just five yards shorter than the par five 13th. A big drive is required to the top of a hill before the fairway begins fading right and then finally banking slightly left. Rae's Creek rests on the left side of the green and wraps around the back instilling fear into players as they hit their approach from the fairway that tilts left. Birdies are very rare at the 11th hole, the most famous of which was Larry Mize's improbable 140 foot chip that found the bottom of the cup and won the 1987 playoff over Greg Norman. Bogies (or worse) outnumbered birdies nearly 4:1 in the 2013 Masters; bogey beware indeed!"
14,Augusta National,top100,"Augusta, GA",Alister MacKenzie/Bobby Jones,1933,Augusta National Golf Club - A Cinderella Story,John Sabino,rev014_augusta_2,"""I shall never forget my first visit to the property... The long lane of magnolias through which we approached was beautiful. The old manor house with its cupola and walls of masonry two feet thick was charming. The rare trees and shrubs of the old nursery were enchanting. But when I walked out on the grass terrace under the big trees behind the house and looked down over the property the experience was unforgettable.""

Augusta Entry Drive

The quote leading off the post is not mine, but is from Bobby Jones. His recollection is from seeing the property before the course was built and it is still the perfect description of it to this day. My attempt to capture my day at Augusta is below. Lou Holtz once said, ""I'm often asked to explain the mystique of Notre Dame. I reply, 'If you were there, no explanation in necessary. If you weren't, no explanation is satisfactory'."" For those who haven't had the opportunity to play it, it is quite difficult for words to do it justice. For those who are among the lucky ones who have, no explanation is necessary.

Augusta National Golf Club (ranked #5 in the world) is the hardest course in the top 100 to get on. I probably have to qualify my prior sentence so I don't get bombarded with email from Down Under reminding me that Ellerston Golf Club is probably the hardest in the world to get on, but that's another story and wasn't on my to do list. It took me fifteen years to get invited to Augusta National, but I finally managed to do it in style. All the pictures on this post were happily taken with my camera, and as you can see, the conditions were perfect when I was there. It was 74 degrees and sunny with a slight wind.

What better circumstances are there to play Augusta National than when the azaleas are blooming, when the course is in tournament condition and with a Masters winner or two? Well, none.

I saved the best experience for last, and walking off the eighteenth green of Augusta National as the last hole to complete my quest is the only way to finish. I am one very lucky bastard.

After I was invited to play at Augusta National it was overwhelming, and it took several days for me to come back down to earth. Because I am just a little anal and clearly I like lists, I immediately began to keep three: 1) People who were previously my friends who told me they now hated me from jealousy; 2) People who offered to caddie for me if needed; and 3) People who wanted ""Augusta National"" and not ""Masters"" logo items that you can only buy in the pro shop in the clubhouse. Sleeping the night before playing at Augusta was restless at best, the sense of anticipation was crushing. Sitting in my hotel room prior to the round, I was a clinical example of adult ADHD and displayed all the symptoms in classic form: inattention, hyperactivity and impulsiveness. I was babbling, moving things around the room senselessly and not listening to a word my wife said.

What was it like?

Short answer: Wow!

Long answer: It was one of the greatest experiences of my life, if a bit overwhelming. Driving under the canopy of trees lining Magnolia Lane is something I never dreamed would happen to me, so the range of emotions that I felt when it happened were wide, as I was trying to comprehend my dream being realized. The most prevalent feelings were joy, fear, excitement, disbelief, exhilaration and anticipation.

As anyone who has ever been to the Masters knows, everything about the place is perfect. Walking through the door of the plantation-style antebellum clubhouse is as memorable an experience as riding down Magnolia Lane. Having previously been to the Masters twice, I had already experienced the jaw-dropping awe of the property and its rolling hills. Not that it ever gets old, because it doesn't. Being anywhere on the verdant Augusta grounds is special, no matter how many times you have been there. This time, being able to walk into the clubhouse, an act previously verboten, was truly amazing. I do believe I had the biggest smile of my life on my face when I entered.

As with everything else in this adult version of Disneyland, the interior of the stately clubhouse is flawless. It is the antithesis of glitz and ostentation; it is simple, but elegant; the ultimate embodiment of understated Southern charm. There are scores of little touches they get right, including a mounted display board in the entry foyer. The board has slots that hold the engraved names of members who are currently on the property. They slide little brass name plates in and out as members enter and leave the property. I did my best not to gawk at the board, but did recognize a couple of names, including a former Secretary of State who was present. The clubhouse, with a two-story veranda around the entire building was built in 1854; is a veritable museum; touring it is special, as it holds the permanent Masters trophy, special golf clubs donated to the club from past champions and a big oil painting of President Eisenhower. Ascending the winding stairway leads you to the second floor, which houses the dining room where they hold the champions dinner each year and the champions locker room. Starting with Bobby Jones, and thinking about all the great golfers who have been in the clubhouse and walked over these hallowed grounds over the last 80 years gives me goosebumps.

My warm-up was on the driving range used during the Masters instead of on the members driving range. I have obviously played a lot of good golf courses and have experienced teeing off at some famous locales that are pressure packed, such as the Old Course at St. Andrews and the first tee at Merion with lunch in progress. Hitting my first tee shot at Augusta was the most nerve-racking of all and shortened both my breath and my back swing. My palms were sweaty and my stomach full of butterflies. The first drive is over a big swale, and although the fairway is wide, the target area is not, since it narrows between the huge bunker on the right and the big Georgia pines on the left. In retrospect, it was one of the narrowest fairway landing areas on the course. Making contact with the ball on the first tee was special. Having the ball actually go my normal distance down the fairway was a bonus!

I played well on the first six holes, then the gravity of the situation hit me and I fell apart for two holes. It is really hard to comprehend that I was lucky enough to be able to actually play Augusta National. Many thanks to the caddies who helped me stay calm and in the present and enjoy the moment. Just as all roads lead to Rome, all golfers dream of the back nine at Augusta on a Sunday afternoon, and here I am in just such a spot.

The practice putting green is near the tenth tee at Augusta National. After we teed off on ten, a multiple-time winner and Ryder Cup captain walks up to the tee and says, ""Do you guys mind if I join you on the back?"" Hard to conceive of, right? My playing partner says, ""No problem with me, John, is it ok if he joins us?"" What am I going to say, ""No, I'm sort of in a groove, why don't we continue as a two-some!"" My fairy tale story continues...

Nelson Bridge #13 Augusta
Nelson Bridge over Rae's Creek from the 13th tee to the 13th fairway, as seen from Hogan Bridge

From tee to green there is no rough; so, truth be told, putting your ball in play is actually not that hard. The course plays 6,365 yards from the member tees. The fairways are generous, they look and feel like carpets, and every lie is perfect. The greens are also perfection, without question the best in the world.  The most difficult shots tee to green are those you have to hit off of the pine needles if you hit off the fairway. The real tests of Augusta National are chipping, holding your ball on the greens and putting. The greens are fast, as you would expect. They are significantly harder on the back nine, in my humble opinion. In particular, I found the thirteenth, fourteenth, sixteenth, seventeenth and eighteenth to be like putting on the top of a glass table.

I am an average golfer (15 handicap) and if there is one hope that I had going into the round it was to play Amen Corner well. A sense of calm and peace overtook me as I walked onto the eleventh tee. To be able to hit the same shots the professionals hit is a dream every golfer has. To be able to pull it off and not cease up was a treat. One of the highlights of my life was hitting the middle of the eleventh green in regulation (the hole plays 400 yards from the member tees) with a shot that got a ""great shot"" shout out from two former tournament winners. Luckily, my birdie putt was captured by my alert caddie who knew the gravity of the moment and took the camera out of my golf bag without being asked. I rolled it to within six inches. I was not disappointed with a tap in par to start Amen Corner. Walking over the Hogan Bridge is something that cannot be described; it is a solemn, spiritual experience.

Birdie Putt on #11 Augusta
Putting for birdie on #11 on a brilliant day with the azaleas in bloom

Standing on the twelfth tee I mentally blocked out the water, the ultra-shallow green, the bunkers in the front and in back, and everything else. I adjusted perfectly for the one club wind, visualized the shot, saw only the flag and took a very deep breath. I ended up hitting one of the best shots of my life, eight feet from the hole. This is the reason you stand on the range year after year and hit tens of thousands of practice balls; so that when you need to, you can pull off the shot of your life, and it was satisfying. On #12 the member tee and the pro tee are in the same place, so I had the exact same shot they hit during the Masters, a 155-yarder over Rae's Creek. My putt broke a good cup and a half and when it landed in the bottom of the hole for birdie, it was hard to absorb. I have had my ups and downs with my golf game over the years, but it was very satisfying to birdie what Jack Nicklaus calls, ""the hardest hole in tournament golf."" I was one under through two holes on Amen Corner, and hit a drive straight down the middle of the thirteenth fairway.  I didn't so much walk over Nelson Bridge as I did float over it.

#13 tee Augusta
The view from the back tee on the thirteenth

My luck ran out when my ball rolled back off the thirteenth green, but I was still overjoyed, having just lived every golfer's dream. When the legendary golf writer Herbert Warren Wind coined the phrase ""Amen Corner,"" he described it as your second shot on the 11th, the entire 12th hole and your tee shot on 13. In the original true sense of Amen Corner, I played it to near perfection. My favorite hole was the thirteenth; it is just breathtaking and on a scale that most golf holes can never achieve. The back tee on the thirteenth is one of the most peaceful places in the world. It sits in a little alcove set among the splendor and beauty of Augusta, and standing there one has not a care in the world.

#13 green Augusta
The approach to the par five thirteenth green over Rae's Creek

I am blessed, and for some reason the golf gods were good enough to let me play to my handicap when I played Augusta National. As is typical, I had my ups and downs. I hit my tee shot on sixteen into the water,  pulled my ball through the Eisenhower Tree on seventeen, hit my fair share of chip shots fat and three putted more than normal, as the greens were tournament ready. After my final putt dropped on the eighteenth green I shook hands with two green jacket winners. To say I was in a state of elation is a gross understatement. At that moment, I was the luckiest man on the face of the earth.

As an added bonus, after the round I also got to play the par three course and to have a drink in the champions locker room. It is quite small and intimate, with only three tables that seat four at each. The veranda outside the room overlooks the circular entry drive and Magnolia Lane. The room was full when I entered and I will leave it to your imagination as to who was in the room and what happened next. If I told you, you wouldn't believe me anyway. Hollywood couldn't have scripted it any better.

I have a big imagination. You have to, to envision playing Augusta and completing this quest. My experience at Augusta National exceeded anything I could have ever imagined. Any one of my experiences that day are remarkable in and of their own right. Are my descriptions hyperbole? Not in the least, when you experienced what I did as the culmination of a long journey. Collectively, they are truly hard to take in and represent a dream come true. The title song from The Wizard of Oz sums up my day:

Somewhere over the rainbow, way up high
There's a land that I've heard of once in a lullaby.
Somewhere over the rainbow, skies are blue
And the dreams that you dare to dream,
Really do come true.

Would you go if invited?

Links Magazine did a readers poll a couple of years back and asked the following question, ""You're on a business trip in Atlanta and have an important meeting that cannot be rescheduled. The night before the meeting, you receive a last minute invitation to play Augusta National Golf Club the following morning. What do you do?""

57% responded that they would skip and meeting and play
43% said they would attend the meeting

The 43% are clearly out of their mind. Are you kidding me?

What PGA players think about Augusta

Sports Illustrated polled the players in 2012 about the Masters. Their answers are below and my opinion in parenthesis.

1. The 11th hole was ranked as the hardest. (I think the seventh and tenth holes are harder)

2. The 12th hole was ranked as the best hole and as the favorite shot on the course (hard to disagree)

3. The 13th hole was ranked as their favorite hole (I agree)

4. 62% of them had never tried the pimento cheese sandwich!

5. 50% of those polled said the major they would most like to win would be the Masters

Some of my favorite quotes about Augusta

""The course is perfection, and it asks perfection"" - Nick Faldo

""You get the feeling that Bobby Jones is standing out there with you"" - Lee Janzen

""I always said that if they have a golf course like this in heaven, I want to be the head pro"" - Gary Player

Augusta truisms

There are three truisms that anyone who has been to the Masters knows:

1. The neighborhood the course is in is more befitting to a suburban strip mall in New Jersey and is lined with Waffle Houses and fast food chains.

2. The steepness of the terrain doesn't come through on TV. Especially how much the first hole plays down and up. Also, the uphill shots required on nine and eighteen are much more dramatic when seen in person, given the big elevation changes. The most dramatic hole of all is the tenth, which plays almost straight down hill.

3. The entire property is perfect. Quite literally perfect. There are no weeds. Nothing is out of place. Those who have been to the Masters know how perfect it is, including the wooden pine bathroom houses that are spotless. The interior of the clubhouse is also perfect. I don't know if they paint the place every day, but the interiors of the buildings look like they were freshly painted. The flooring is polished, the carpets are spotless and look freshly laid, and the lucky people working there are charming and gracious, and make you feel at home. No detail is too small to overlook at Augusta National. Inside the clubhouse they don't use an electric vacuum cleaner since the noise would disturb the perfect ambiance of the place. Instead, they use an old school push style that makes no noise.

Unlike any other

Pine Valley is the #1 ranked course in the world and Cypress Point is #2, and an absolute dream land. Everyone talks about Pebble Beach, and you get chills playing the Old Course at St. Andrews when they announce your name on the first tee. But the course EVERYBODY asks about when I tell them what I've been doing is Augusta. Have you played Augusta? How did you get on Augusta?

I have played in some unreal and memorable places. My day at Loch Lomond was exceptional. My experience and the ambiance of the hunting lodge at Morfontaine is still something I think about all the time. It is also pretty hard to beat an overnight stay at The National Golf Links of America. Yet, this is the one to tell the grand kids about (some day). Everyone I meet in my life from now on will hear about my birdie on the twelfth hole.

Augusta trivia

Some interesting trivia facts about Augusta taken mostly from David Owen's The Making of the Masters:

1. The tress that line Magnolia Lane were planted before the Civil War

2. President Eisenhower never attended the Masters because of possible security problems

3. Before there were tour caddies, golfers recruited bellhops from the local Bon-Air Hotel to serve as caddies

4. Cliff Roberts handled Eisenhower's personal finances and investments

5. The golf shop makes change with new bills because Clifford Roberts didn't like dirty bills

6. There are no tee times at Augusta National. Captains of industry are very civilized and no doubt don't all show up at once. The limited number of cabins for overnight play self-regulates the number of people that play, as most members don't live locally.

7. The two nines originally played in reverse. The 1934 Masters was the only one played with the front and back opposite of the way they play today.

8. Augusta has no slope and course rating from the U.S.G.A. thus you can't really post your score after playing. I'm not sure why they never had the course rated, perhaps to do with privacy and limiting access?


What will you do now that you are done playing the top 100 courses?

People have asked me this question a lot. I contemplated giving up golf altogether, since what I just did can't be topped. Like Bobby Jones, I thought, wouldn't it be great to go out at the top. Jones retired at his peak in 1930 after winning the impregnable quadrilateral, as he termed the Grand Slam. My friends reminded me that I'm no Bobby Jones, so a few other ideas I'm kicking around:

1. Go back to Cruden Bay and play it over and over and over

2. Go and sit in the Sunningdale clubhouse for a week drinking Guinness and smoking cigars

3. Try to join the Links Club in New York

4. Eat at the top 100 restaurants in the world

5. Move to Queenstown, New Zealand, herd sheep and drive a taxi while playing golf at Jack's Point a lot

How did you get on the course?

Unfortunately, like in Las Vegas, what happens at Augusta National stays at Augusta National. This will remain my secret. That is, unless my book deal comes through with its big advance, in which case I will give all the details :). What I can say is that asking to play is futile. Like joining the club, you can't ask them, they have to ask you. Asking to play is an automatic no. Think about it, members would be inundated with requests every day if you could ask them to play since this is the course every golfer obsesses about. In this regard, Augusta National is truly unlike all other golf courses in the world. If you meet a member of Shinnecock Hills or Riviera or many of the other top courses, chances are you can ask them and as long as you are not a total JO, you can usually get invited, as they are proud to show off their course, especially to those that appreciate the history of the game and golf course architecture.  A prior post of mine does outline the ways you can get onto the course:  A Dozen Ways to Play Augusta. Good luck if you are trying, and sorry, I can't help.

What are your favorite courses and holes?

Alas, a complex question best answered by this post: The Best Holes and Courses. My day at Augusta was by far the best overall experience of my journey playing the top 100 courses given what happened to me on that day. In terms of the course only, I would rank only a half-dozen or so courses above it including Cypress Point, Sand Hills, the National Golf Links of America, Merion, and Sunningdale. My top five holes in the world are the thirteenth at Augusta, the fifteenth at Cypress Point, Maidstone's fourteenth, Kawana's fifteenth and the seventh at Sunningdale.

Was it hard to play the top 100 golf courses in the world?

Yes. To put the feat in perspective, by completing my quest I become only the 23rd person to do so, the same number of men who have been to the moon: The list of those who have completed playing. I tried to calculate the percentage of people in the world that have done this and dividing 23 into 7 billion gave a result with a lot of zeros after the decimal point. The odds of winning the lottery are higher than the odds of playing all 100 of the top golf courses in the world.

The hardest courses to get on aside from Augusta are Morfontaine in France, Hirono and Nauro in Japan, Wade Hampton in North Carolina, San Francisco Golf Club and The Golf Club in Ohio.

Thank you 

A heartfelt thanks to everyone who has been kind to me along the way, particularly those that hosted me and had to tolerate looking at my terrible swing. Thank you to all my loyal and supportive readers. Special thanks to my mates Tom, Chris and Sheldon who accompanied me to many of the world's great golf courses and are fabulous company. We have shared many laughs together. Thank you for being such good friends, I couldn't have done it without you. The biggest thanks of all goes to the most tolerant and greatest wife in the world! Thank you.

One of the lessons learned from this experience is to be patient. I pressed hard to get on Augusta for years and for the last two had sort of given up, and figured completing the top 99 courses in the world would be a pretty good feat. Little did I know that all those previous no's and rejections in my attempt to play the course were for a reason. Fate had decided that my quest should end with the ultimate climax. Just like in your game, sometimes when you give up, you play your best. Other lessons learned: be nice to everyone you meet, think big, have perseverance and persistence, and believe. There is no way to pay everyone back that helped me, so I will continue to pay it forward and share my luck and good fortune with others.

This will be my last post now that the quest is complete.

Post Script - Did I mention I birdied twelve?"
15,Merion (East),top100,"Ardmore, PA",Hugh Wilson,1912,MERION GOLF CLUB (EAST) - 18 POINTS,David Jones,rev015_merion_1,"It’s funny how you can have an idea of what a golf course is going to look and feel like, just to be completely contradicted as soon as you get there. Merion would be a perfect example of that for me. In my mind I had this as a heavily tree-lined, slightly claustrophobic, incredibly tight course. It is tight, because of the lush rough, but it is actually one of the most open properties that I have ever played. On much of the way around you can pretty much see the whole course and it really does have an ‘open’ feel to it.

I was luck to play here just a few months after the renovation by Gil Hanse and this is clearly a really quality golf course that is at the top of its game. The conditioning was just superb, with the greens running very true and just beautiful to play on. While the conditioning was spot on, it’s worth saying that the rough was fairly brutal. It was very thick, meaning sometimes it was hard to find the ball, and always difficult to move it forward. Having played a lot of golf in a short period of time prior to arriving at Merion, it would be fair to say I wasn’t firing on all cylinders and as such spent far too long looking balls in the thick stuff!

If you look at the scorecard for Merion it looks like this should be a course you can score on - from the members’ tees we played it was about a 6,200 yard par 70. While that may look inviting, believe me it plays so much harder. Anyone who keeps to handicap around here is worth a good 2 or 3 shots when they go somewhere else. 

If you are a fan of quirks then Merion is right up your alley. One such example if that there are only 2 par 5s on the property, and they both come in the first 4 holes! 

The course has a distinctive rhythm to it - with the thirds often referred to as Drama, Comedy and Tragedy.  The first six holes certainly ask some tough questions. After the dogleg first you find a par 5 with beguiling OOB on the right and then the long par 3 third where you need to fly the ball all the way to the green to avoid punishing rough and bunkers. However, by the 7th things definitely calm down and you then have a bunch of short par 4s and a couple of great par 3s - one long and one short. While this may tempt you into thinking you can attack the course a little don’t be fooled, be off line and the punishment will be just as bad as on the first 6 holes. This stretch of holes has some of the most of interesting and most fun holes you will find anywhere, with some wonderful, memorable nuances. 
The restored approach to the 16th at Merion is visually stunning and quite a test
The restored approach to the 16th at Merion is visually stunning and quite a test

The finish at Merion is tremendous - one of the very best you will find anywhere. The 16th is a par 4 where, for your second shot, you are forced to play over a quarry which Hanse has now restored with wonderful bunkering. There is a path around the right if you don’t fancy the carry. I went for the heroic route and failed. 

The 17th is a long par 3 - over 240 yards from the championship tees - which plays downhill to a huge (by Merion standards) green with a lot of movement in it. 

And then to the 18th, where Hogan famously hit his approach shot in the US Open all those years ago. From the championship tees it is a tough task. It’s a blind tee shot and then a long iron in to this green with a huge false front meaning that par here is a really great score. It really is a stunning finish. 

Looking back, I wish I had planned my trip to Philadelphia slightly differently. We played Pine Valley twice before making the trip to Merion and maybe it would have been better to have it the other way. Pine Valley is so ridiculously magnificent in every way, Merion was always going to be hard-pushed to match it.

Don’t get me wrong - this is a very fine course. Pretty much every hole asked a good question - how best to survive or how best to take advantage of what you have in front of you. The course looks wonderful. By all accounts Hanse has elevated it to a new level and the test is strong. 

However, something stopped me quite falling in love with this course. Much is made of how the routing works so well on a pretty small piece of land. Of course, that’s true, but Kingston Heath knocks it out of the park with the same challenge. The rough here is a little too brutal, and the punishment for missing the greens too great, to make this course a really fun one to play. 

Having said that all of that, of course if you get the chance to tee it up here you should jump at it. It’s championship golf of the highest order and a course that any fan of the history of the game would want to see.
BOOKING THE COURSE

OK, you can’t exactly call up Merion to book a tee time but it isn’t quite in Pine Valley’s league. Having said that, at some courses, like Shinnecock, you can play without a member being on the property with you. Not at Merion - here you need to be hosted at all times. The good news is that there are a lot of members and many of them play here quite regularly and are keen to show off the course. If you haven’t got a friendly member on speed dial then set up a Google alert for Merion charity auctions. Members quite often auction off the chance to play with them and there are also a few charity days. It’s not cheap, but it is possible.
The scorecard from Merion

TOUR TIPS

Merion is one of the great old courses in the USA and it would be a shame not to factor in plenty of time to explore the club. One of the most famous features here is the terrace that sits next to the first tee where members will be having their lunch while you tee off. In fact, when we played, the members tees were set slightly forward from the throng and it didn’t feel like we had too many eyes on us as we teed off.

This didn’t feel as ‘old school’ a club as Shinnecock or NGLA. We were there on a Sunday afternoon and there were a lot of women around as well as a bunch of kids and it had a little more of a ‘country club’ atmosphere to it. Having said that they were sticklers for etiquette and there is no doubt that golf is the focus here.

The pro shop is really well stocked and it’s hard to leave without a few items adorned with the wicker basket logo. The locker rooms were as traditional as they come and the showers had water pressure that even Muirfield would be happy with. We were heading off for a transatlantic flight straight after the round so had a good shower, but the lack of curtains did give off a certain ‘1950s British Boys’ School’ ambience which I think could have been done without!"
16,Merion (East),top100,"Ardmore, PA",Hugh Wilson,1912,Review: Merion Golf Club (East),Andrew Harvie,rev016_merion_2,"Merion is, well, everyone knows of Merion, but most people don’t actually know that there’s two golf courses at this storied club. The West, down the road, is also a Wilson/Flynn, and the East, which is the one most of us have heard of. Needless to say, my expectations were high going in. I had a great day planned with two of my best golf pals and our host, who was a rockstar (which only enhanced the experience by a mile!). Back to the golf. Let’s jump into this wonderful little golf course.

Act I: The Drama

Merion’s East course is divided into three acts. Like a Shakespearean play, each act tells a different story and provides a different task. However, Shakespeares play are five acts (18 holes isn’t divisible by 5!). To start the golf course, you’re greeted with a 350 yard par 4.


Many have talked about how difficult the first tee shot is. No, not because it’s tight or long (obviously not), but because of how close it is to the patio of the clubhouse restaurant. You are steps from people having lunch. Thankfully, we teed off at 3:00 on a rainy October afternoon, so not too many people watching!


Just a couple spectators for the opening tee shot. On a warm summer afternoon this would be packed!
The opening hole gracefully moves to the right around a pair of fairway bunkers. A greenside bunker on the right side forces the player to go to the outside corner for a better angle.


As you can tell, I didn’t pick the right side of the fairway
After crossing Ardmore Ave, the first of two par 5’s on the golf course await. 589 yards on the card, it’s a long par 5 with O.B. all down the right and fairway bunkering on the left.


As I blasted one O.B., my host told me “you haven’t played Merion until you’ve hit one onto Ardmore Ave!” Happy to say I hit the ceremonial ball O.B. then, although it didn’t help my score too much.

This is kind of the first introduction to the scale of Merion. In the suburbs of Philadelphia, you wouldn’t expect this much movement, but it’s quite uphill on the second shot! Avoid the bunker for the second shot and you should be good to go.


The green angles to the left, in typical fashion. The closer to the right (and O.B.) you go, the better your look into the green becomes. With a wedge, however, not a huge deal.


Somewhere early in the stages, Merion, like National Golf Links of America, had template holes all over. There was a Sahara, Redan, Eden—some of them or soft renditions. Somewhere in the early stages as well, C.B. Macdonald, the pioneer of templates in North America, was involved. The third, originally, was thought of as a reverse redan template. Today, it doesn’t play too much like a redan.

At 219 yards to a green cut on the other side of the gully, it’s a beast.


I haven’t wrote too much about the greens yet, but they’re very difficult. There’s a ton of movement, and often times, there’s massive ridges running through the middle of the green that can make it very difficult to get to back pins. On the 3rd, with a back left pin, we saw that in action. A closer look at the green complex on the 3rd with the beautiful wicker basket.


The 4th is a monster par 5 at 628 yards. The aiming bunker cut into the hill is a perfect line to rip one over.


Words don’t really describe how difficult this second shot is. Frankly, it could be the most difficult layup shot on a par 5 I’ve ever played. A huge bunker cut at the top of the hill is perfectly placed. The length makes this an issue, even though it’s 200 yards or so to the green from there. If you play over it, you don’t see the ball land and you’re playing from a downhill lie. If you lay back, you’re dealing with the bunker and a potential blind third shot with a long club in.


The green is quite big with lots of pin locations, but there’s a copious amount of bunkers surrounding the green, and Cobb’s Creek fronts the green as well.


This is such a strong par 5. Par here is an excellent score. And that’s the last of the par 5’s! Merion ends with two par 5’s coming in the first 4 holes. From here on out, it’s 3’s & 4’s. You can get a sense of the scale below.


And the elevation profile. It really shows you how downhill the hole actually plays


The 5th, once described by Tom Doak as the world’s only “perfect par 4” would be the best hole on almost every other golf course in the world. It very well could be the best hole here, but there’s a couple contenders to me. At 504 yards, it’s a beast with a creek slithering along on the left. The hole banks hard to the left, with the fairway’s right side higher than the left side by about 15 (!) feet. hitting it up onto the right side is ideal.


From there, the hole continues to pitch hard to the right. A bunker up on the right hand side catches balls that need to be laid up (hazard, bunker, or rough, whichever). A line just over the the left edge of the bunker is ideal to kick the ball down.


I wish I would’ve got more photos of this hole because it is so good. But funny story: I actually drove through the night from Toronto to get to Philadelphia, picked up my friend who took the red eye from Edmonton, Alberta, and went and played Cobb’s Creek with a couple of local GCA enthusiasts the morning prior to Merion. It was a big day, I might’ve missed a couple photo opportunities.

Hole 6 is another difficult par 4 that we played around 440 yards. The US Open tee is out of commission, I believe, which would’ve been around 490. Two bunkers left and one aiming bunker right help you navigate the blind landing area.


The approach is a bit more low-profile than the first couple holes, but a false front stops balls. It’s a good green with quite a bit of movement towards the front.


Act II: The Comedy

What’s really special about this golf course is the routing. You don’t notice it through the writing, but 2 goes to the outside, then you turn inside for 3, 4, then 5 wraps back in between 4 and 2, and 6 comes out near hole 2 before turning to the outside of hole 4 for 7-9. Merion’s routing loops in on itself, but it wasn’t always like this. Here’s the previous version:


Quite a bit has actually changed from this original routing thanks to William Flynn. Hole 1 is different. The routing has also been switched up a bit. On that photo, holes 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 are actually 6, 7, 4, 5, & 3 in that order. Additionally, 10, 11 and 12 are very different on todays golf course, but we’ll get there. Below is the current routing.


The 7th starts the “Comedy” stretch of the golf course. Where the “Drama” gets the golf course onto a mixed bag start, the “Comedy” portion is made up of four short par 4’s, a long 3, one short 3, and a mid-length 4. It’s a great stretch of holes to make birdies. One of the beauties of Merion is that good players know they need to make birdies here to make it through the final Act, while members may sneak in a couple pars in this stretch and be happy with it.

Anyways, the 7th is 360 yards with O.B. to the right. One bunker on the left is probably best avoided, and this is the bunker you stood next to on the tips for hole 4.


The green it perched up, pitching hard to the front. With a wedge or short iron in hand, it can be difficult to control spin.


The 8th is a very good golf hole. 356 yards, a bunker right and left are staggered. Depending on the yardage you choose to play off the tee, one of the two will be in play.


A bunker short left and the restored ditch from Gil Hanse on the right front the green here. It slopes hard towards the ditch on the right. With a pin on the right side, it can be tough to keep the ball below the hole.


The 9th is a monster par 3 at 231 yards with Cobb’s Creek fronting the green and a huge bunker that the green wraps around on the left.


Here’s a different, closer to angle to hopefully show the undulation of this green. It’s a lot.


The 10th is a fun, drivable par 4 at 303 yards. Swinging hard to the left around a bunker on the inside corner, a layup (if you elect to layup) will have to flirt with the four bunkers on the outside corner for the best angle.


A big bunker short of the green from the tee and left from the fairway is the main defence. The green is more subtle in nature than the past couple, so a great birdie opportunity.


The 11th is most likely the most famous hole at Merion. Bobby Jones in 1930 completed the grand slam on the 11th green. Since then, it’s obviously become a milestone hole. At 367 yards, it’s a short hole playing downhill. A shared bunker complex on the left with hole 12 might be in play for some, but I imagine most will get it down the hill.


To a small green tucked behind Cobb’s Creek, it’s a very fun wedge to hit. As long as your ball doesn’t stay on the downslope, you’ll be good!


Part of the restoration, Gil Hanse & his team raised this green to prevent flooding from Cobb’s Creek, which has happened (so I’m told) fairly regularly if they get a rainy spring.

The 12th is a 403 yard par 4 doglegging up the hill that the 11th fell down. Three bunkers on the outside corner are wonderful aiming lines, but don’t get in them!


The fairway cants hard to the right, which actually helps the ball travel closer to the hole and sets up a fade to a green angled to the right. There is so much movement towards the front in this green that being under the green is paramount. Had it not been misting all day, I could see someone putting off the front of this green pretty easily if they’re above the hole.


The 13th plays on the other side of Armore Ave, and you won’t cross it again. It’s a very short par 3 at 115 yards, but ask Phil Mickelson—it’s not easy!


From experience, don’t hit it in that front bunker. Again, there is a ton of movement in this green, and almost collects like an upside down saddle (at least on the right side).

Act III: The Tragedy

After the drama and the comedy set the stage, the tragedy is all ready to ruin your round. It’s 5 holes of absolute madness.

The 14th is a 425 yard par 4 swinging hard to the left around a bunker that’s 275 to carry. A slew of bunkers on the outside corner of the hole await as well, and if you get really anxious, O.B. is way left. Getting the ball in play here is paramount.


You’ll notice on the approach shot instead of the wicker baskets it’s now the white flags. The club collects these wicker baskets and switches them out towards the end of the night because fraternity members at nearby Villanova University challenge other rushing members to steal a wicker basket to get access to the fraternity. Crazy!


This greens best characteristic, in my opinion, is the back left portion of the green, which is very cool and adds a fun pin position.

The 15th, a 411 yard par 4 swinging to the right, is harder than the yardage lists. O.B. all on the outside corner of the dogleg is certainly in play. It’s a different take; typically O.B. is seen on the inside corner (even last hole!) and you work on not turning it towards the hazard too much. On the 15th, you make sure you turn it away enough!


Playing up the hill, the approach shot up is a difficult one to judge. Again, a ton of movement towards the front of the hole, and certainly in the front portion. Staying below the hole is the best call to action.


The 16th starts. areal ‘meat & potatoes’ tough as nails finishing stretch. At around 440 yards, it’s not overly long. Getting the ball in play is so key here. If you miss, it’s not good.


From there, you chuck up a Hail Mary mid to long iron to a big green over the quarry. For the record, I hit it into the quarry and it wasn’t good. I did make a good up & down for 7, but that’s beside the point.


To make matters harder, the green has a massive ridge running through the middle that makes anything in the back half incredibly hard to get close to.

For those who miss the fairway, or have too much stick in for their second, the restored bail out on the right (which is actually 15 tee) is a perfect spot to play the 3rd from. Here’s a view of the quarry. Again—don’t hit it in here.


The 17th is a 246 yard (!!!) par 3. Working its way back down into the bottom of the quarry, it plays. a bit down the slope.


A fairly big ridge in the front portion of this green stops a lot of balls from running up. It’s said that this dip in the fairway/ridge in the green is inspired by the Valley of Sin at St Andrews. If it wasn’t hard enough, the green is surrounded by bunkering.


The 18th is a monster par 4 to finish. 510 yards, it requires a carry of 240 or so yards over the carry just to get the ball in play.


Playing over some wonderful rolling terrain, the 18th is a wonderful finish to an epic day at Merion.


So that’s Merion! It’s a very strong golf course. Speaking on the golf course, Jack Nicklaus famously stated:

Acre for acre, this may be the best test of golf in the world
No doubt, Merion at 126 acres is a very impressive golf course. It still blows my mind that on such small acreage, you never feel cramped, and the scale is quite big. After Gil Hanse’s restoration, it’s looking and playing great. One of the most special days in golf for me, and a course I’ll remember forever!"
17,Fishers Island,top100,"Fishers Island, NY",Seth Raynor,1926,Raynor’s Final Symphony: Fishers Island Club,Andy Johnson,rev017_fishers_1,"Architects are often judged by their masterpieces. For Alister Mackenzie, it’s Cypress Point. For Charles Blair Macdonald, it’s National Golf Links of America. For Donald Ross, it’s Seminole. For A.W. Tillinghast, it’s Winged Foot. For Seth Raynor, it’s the Fishers Island Club.

Special thanks to Jon Cavalier for use of his photos in this profile. Seth Raynor was cast as C.B. Macdonald’s right hand man for the early years of his career. But as Macdonald’s interest in designing courses waned, job inquiries trickled down to Raynor, who perfected his architecture craft and gained a deeper understanding of the game at courses like Shoreacres, Camargo, Blue Mound, Yeamans Hall and the Course at Yale. Fishers Island was Raynor’s final and greatest symphony. During his short but illustrious career, Raynor often turned less-than-desirable land sites into spectacular courses. His portfolio of template holes – the redan, cape, short, biarritz and double plateau – ensured a course delivered a fun, thought-provoking and strategic test. At Fishers he got a waterfront property with tremendous natural land movement. He turned it into one of the finest courses in the world. Unfortunately Raynor didn’t live to see the end product. He caught pneumonia as Fishers Island was nearing completion, forcing his associate Charles Banks to finish the course.
The experience

Entrances are often talked about at golf courses. The drive into a club builds anticipation and excitement for the day. Fishers offers a truly unique “entrance” – a ferry ride across the Long Island Sound to the island. Coming from the Nauck Harbor, we rode the Popeye shuttle and arrived at the dock situated off of the 17th hole. After a quick stroll down the wood planks, our carts awaited us and we drove to the clubhouse. Unlike many exclusive clubs, Fishers Island is the furthest thing from “stuffy,” offering a laid-back vacation vibe that makes you feel at home.

We met the superintendents, Don Beck and David McIntyre, by the putting green, each of whom quickly apologized for how “green the course was,” music to our group’s ears. It was subtle, but the comment exemplified what Fishers is – a golf course architecture fan’s nirvana. For first-time readers, let me make it clear that there is nothing I love more than a firm and fast golf course. I believe that the effort to present a green golf course is one of the major issues with golf, creating sustainability issues and promoting poorer playing conditions for the average player. Raynor was known for his bold green concepts; the redan, the double plateau and the punchbowl have massive ridges that make them easily distinguishable. But the subtle ridges, rolls, spines and humps in his putting surfaces at Fishers are what places them among the best in the world. These design subtleties are woven in from the tee through the green on every hole at Fishers Island. I often judge a golf course by whether it inspires an immediate replay. At Fishers, my play was not good, but on the 17th hole I was sad to see the round nearing its end. The course and club deserve all of the acclaim and possibly more. It’s one of the finest golf courses in the world.
A quick history lesson

Started by the Ferguson family in 1925, the Fishers Island Club was set out to be modeled after Mountain Lake, the vibrant country club community in Lake Wales, FL. Naturally the Fergusons went after the man behind Mountain Lake, Seth Raynor, to design their golf course on the farmlands of Fishers Island. Upon walking the property, Raynor found two superior sites for 18 hole golf courses, one where Fishers Island sits today and another that was planned to be developed until the Great Depression cut plans short and the additional course’s development was abandoned. Over the years, Fishers has done an exemplary job of keeping the original golf course intact and staying true to Raynor’s intentions, planting few to no trees, maintaining firm and fast conditions and recently undergoing work to recapture the original green sizes.
The course

The 6,636-yard par-70 course is filled with jaw-dropping vistas of the Long Island Sound and Raynor’s famed template holes. Two of Raynor’s standout skills – routing and building green complexes – are on full display at the venerable site. His routing maximizes the holes on the water, providing drama at every turn while using the natural land movement as his fairway hazard, only employing two fairway bunkers on the course. The overlooked aspect of Fishers’ routing is how nearly every hole plays in a different direction, which allows the course’s best defense, the wind, to play a starring role. Golfers are kept in a constant state of confusion as they try to find the exact direction and strength of the wind on a given hole.

While a few holes are similar in direction, none are identical

HOLE #1 “Raynor’s Start” – 396 yards – par 4 As is customary with most Raynor designs, the first is a friendly start. The wind is typically at your back and the tee shot plays downhill. The water on the right comes into play 300 yards from the tee, requiring longer players to choose whether or not to play aggressively. The fairway cants from left to right, and the green is perched with a light back to front slope playing slightly uphill. One of the subtle, strategic aspects of the 1st is how the safe play off the tee is down the left side, but on that half of the fairway the left-to-right slope is severe. Consequently, a shot to the left of the fairway yields a more challenging approach shot than the flatter right half, which carries the risk of the water.
HOLE #2 “Redan” – 184 yards – par 3 The original green for the 2nd hole was lost to a hurricane, forcing the club to rebuild the green. The hole plays slightly downhill and the wind is a critical factor. As with all redan holes, the green slants from front-to-back and right-to-left around a deep front bunker. Unlike most golf holes, the ideal miss on the redan is long which leaves an uphill putt or chip to the pin. This rebuilt version of the template is gentler than most, and therefore plays more tamely, especially with regard to the kick slope.
HOLE #3 “Plateau” – 335 yards – par 4 One of the most memorable holes at Fishers Island is the short par-4 third, which plays uphill and seemingly to the edge of the world. The hole doglegs slightly to the right and tests the appetite for risk. The safe play is a long-iron up the left side, but a well-struck driver can get long-hitters close or even home. The dominant features at the 3rd are treacherous greenside bunkers, which flank the right and left sides of the narrow back to front sloping green.
HOLE #4 “Punch Bowl” – 412 yards – par 4 The fourth is considered by many to be the greatest golf hole in the United States. It’s a variety of the Alps template and perhaps the greatest version in golf. The strategy of the hole is dependent on the day’s pin position, which is noted by a peg board.

If the flag is on the right side of the green, the left side of the fairway is preferred and vice versa. A smart play is to pull long iron and play it up the fairway, leaving a short to mid-iron approach to the blind green. If you choose to play boldly, a driver that cuts the corner will leave a wedge shot and maybe even a partial view of the green. For those who lay up, the second shot requires trust in your line off of the Fishers Island flag that marks the center of the green. The yardage to the pin cannot be measured by lasers and your swing will feel unstable as the wind typically is whipping down and off the Sound. Coming over the hill and seeing the punchbowl green set back against the ocean is a sight to behold and one that is truly unforgettable. While it has bold exterior contours, Raynor’s subtle spine which runs through the middle is the true genius of this putting surface. The simple contour plays a factor in nearly every pin for shots just a little off-target.
HOLE #5 “Biarritz” – 229 yards – par 3 Continuing on the jaw dropping stretch of holes is the biarritz fifth, which plays parallel to the Long Island Sound, giving the long par-3 the added challenge of strong winds. With the water on the right, the natural bailout for golfers is left, where Raynor places two deep trench bunkers. The front of the biarritz is kept as fairway and when the course is firm and fast, the approach is conducive to low-iron shots that bounce the ball onto the green. The green complex is a big square, which has back to front slope and another subtle ledge that comes into the play on the back half. This divides the left two-thirds of the green from the back-right corner, which is slightly elevated for a devilish pin position.
HOLE #6 “Olinda” – 555 yards – par 5 The first par-5 plays from the shore back into the mainland and shows off the incredible natural land movement on the island. The new tee box is back to the right and semi-blind, favoring a fade to the fairway, which slightly angles right. After reaching the top of the hill, a beautiful view of the green awaits, giving a preview of the terrific seventh hole as well. The 6th often gets overlooked among Fishers’ amazing waterfront holes, but Raynor’s restraint from using fairway bunkers is beautiful, opting to allow the natural rolling land to obstruct players shots and layups. Finding a relatively flat lie is difficult and makes it a challenge to go for the green in two or even lay up in the correct position. The green is another square complex, which slopes from back to front. In the last year the back portion has been recaptured, which repels balls off the green. An interesting aspect of Raynor’s design approach is how on the lengthy par-3 second and the fifth he rewarded players who boldly miss long, while on the shortish par-5 sixth, a bold player who misses is penalized with a very difficult recovery.
HOLE #7 “Latimer” 363 yards – par 4 Perhaps the most overlooked great hole at Fishers Island is the strategy-packed short par-4 seventh. Playing from an elevated tee, the first decision posed to the player is whether to play aggressively with a driver or lay up short of the salt marsh. The second choice is which side of the fairway to favor. The safe side is left but it leaves a poor angle, while the ideal approach comes from the right side but brings the salt marsh into play. Due to the elevated nature of the green, an approach from the fairway is necessary to hold the firm, wind-blown putting surface, which slopes from back to front and features a dramatic false front.
HOLE #8 “Road Hole” 465 yards – par 4

The eighth was converted to a par-4 in the early 2000s and is a challenging rendition of the road hole. With the sound on the right and a pond on the left, a good tee shot is a must to this fairway that slopes heavily from right-to-left. Typically playing into the wind, a solid tee ball still yields a lengthy approach to the tough template green, which is guarded by a deep front pot bunker. There is plenty of room to bail right but it leaves a tricky chip across the green, which slopes from right to left and back to front.
HOLE #9 “Double Plateau” – 365 yards – par 4 Fishers’ front nine comes to a dramatic close with a short par-4, which features one of golf’s greatest green complexes, the double plateau. The tee shot is blind, up over a hill and one of two fairway bunkers on the property. After navigating the tee ball, Raynor treats golfers to another great reveal, as the double plateau green seemingly floats out over the sound. Its bold undulations divide the putting surface into three distinct segments that, when playing firm and fast, make the proper approach angle critical. If the pin is front-left, the proper angle is from the left; front-right, the right side is preferable and with the back pin the center to left side of the fairway is best.
HOLE #10 “Knoll” – 401 yards – par 4 Make the turn and players are treated to a rare sight, an unchanged and original knoll hole, one of Raynor’s templates that was often ruined by greens committees who thought they knew better. Completely bunkerless, the 10th is one of the toughest holes on the course. Finding the fairway is a must to set up a reasonable approach to the elevated green, which repels balls that are slightly short, long, right or left. Depending on the pin position, the favored approach angle will change, giving players a little more green to work with on their approaches. As the wind picks up the 10th only gets tougher.
HOLE #11 “Eden” – 164 yards – par 3 Photos don’t do the 11th justice. The short par-3 is perhaps the best representation of the famed Eden hole at St. Andrews. The green slopes severely from back to front and right to left making any putt from above the pin dicey. The worst place to miss on this challenging par three is in the devastatingly deep “hill” bunker.
HOLE #12 “Winthrop” – 389 yards – par 4 After the truly remarkable waterfront stretch of the Nos. 3-11, Raynor navigates players inland toward a stretch of overlooked holes that possess incredible strategic challenges and phenomenal green complexes. The first of those is the 12th, which embodies a great deal of strategy stemming from its elevated, reverse-redan green complex. Off the tee, players have to decide how aggressively they will play, taking anything from a driver to a long iron. The fairway has ample undulation that moves from left to right and has a large hump which can obstruct approach shots with an uphill or downhill lie. The green slopes hard from left to right and front to back and has a subtle knob in the middle that affects putts to almost every pin. The hole typically plays downwind, which makes the approach shot extremely difficult to hit close because of the green that slopes severely away and is perched some 30 feet above.
HOLE #13 “Waterloo” – 400 yards – par 4 The 13th plays back towards the 12th tee and is a slight dogleg right. Much like the twelfth, the strategy is influenced significantly by the wind direction. If it’s into the prevailing wind, the play off the tee is a driver down the right side of the fairway which opens up the ideal approach angle to the large squared off green, avoiding the second and final fairway bunker, which is blind from the tee. The second shot plays over a pair of ponds and into the green complex, the star of the show. It has a false front and bold kicker on the left corner, which feeds shots toward the center. Raynor bisected the green with a small spine that penalizes players who miss their mark to the right or left and the front-left section of the green has a small bowl that makes for a fun pin.
HOLE #14 “Cape” – 425 yards – par 4 On the flattest piece of the property, Raynor went to the fail safe template he used at every course he designed – the strategy-packed cape hole. Long hitters will be tempted to carry the water down the left at 290 yards, but the prudent play is an iron to the right. The ideal line is down the left side of the fairway, which drastically shortens the approach shot into the green but carries the added risk of the water. I fanned a 3-iron to the right side of the fairway and was left with 200 yards into the green, a number that could have been 30 yards less had I taken my tee shot down the left side. The green is another special one with bunkers on the right and left, and a severe false front. It requires an excellent approach shot to make a birdie. I found the back-left portion of the 14th green to be the most interesting as it features a small ridge that allows for a slightly bolder approach to the green with the comfort of a backstop.
HOLE #15 “Long” – 541 yards – par 5 The 15th starts Fishers’ closing stretch with a reachable par-5. The tee shot is blind and over a marsh obscuring a generously wide fairway. The right side of the fairway opens up the green, especially the back-left corner for those attempting to get home in two. The green slopes heavily from back to front and is guarded by bunkers on either side. The left bunker is particularly deep and a brutal spot to find yourself if the pin is on the left side. Like most greens at Fishers, the 15th has many small intricacies. The right third of the green plays into a small bowl with the left two-thirds elevated and on its own tier.
HOLE #16 “Short” – 146 yards – par 3 This photogenic short hole is extra difficult at Fishers because of the always-present wind. Despite playing less than 150 yards, I was forced to hit a 6-iron because of the prevailing wind, which typically is in player’s face. The green is surrounded by trouble with bunkers catching small misses and marsh penalizing the wide misses. As is typically the case, Raynor saved his wildest green for the short, making par a formidable test on the seemingly easy par-3. The 16th green’s exterior slopes funnel shots on the edges into the bunkers while the center slopes to the right, with a thumbprint on the back half making any putt not directly below the flag extremely fast. The unique aspect of Fishers’ short is the right side, which is obstructed from the tee but allows for a pin that seemingly floats above the marsh. Getting to that pin is a tall task and the prudent play is just slightly left of it, allowing the slope to funnel the ball to the corner.
HOLE #17 “Coast Guard” – 415 yards – par 4 The 17th features one of the widest fairways on the course, which allows players to set up a proper angle to attack the day’s flag. The prevailing wind at Fishers typically has the 17th playing into a strong left-to-right crosswind, which makes the second shot to the big green difficult. The green is sloped from back to front and has a false front which repels any shots slightly short or with too much spin. There is a small spine that runs down the left third of the green, creating an added obstacle for any pin on the left half of the green.
HOLE #18 “Home” – 452 yards – par 5 The closer at Fishers Island is a long and challenging par-4 that plays into the prevailing wind. The tee shot favors a fade and will leave a mid- to long-iron into a boldly-contoured green. The second shot plays uphill and the large, wide green is guarded by bunkers in front and to the right. Raynor gave players an ample opening to play a low running shot into the green, which is divided into three distinct sections: the front-right portion, which slopes significantly from back to left; the back ledge; and the front-left bowl. Hitting the green in two is an accomplishment, but a player who finds themselves on the wrong ledge will be left with a challenging two-putt to close out the round."
18,Fishers Island,top100,"Fishers Island, NY",Seth Raynor,1926,Fishers Island Club: A *Very* Remote and Memorable Round of Golf,Sean Ogle,rev018_fishers_2,"My journey to Fishers Island happened in a very unexpected way.

I was in New York City (you know, back when I used to travel), and saw that I had a friend from out of town who was also in the area on a golf trip.


I shot him a note saying something like “Hey, you’re in NY too?! Any chance you have time to get a round in?”

“Our schedule is pretty tight, but you know, we may actually have a spot for a forth on Wednesday. Let me check.”

“Can you make it to the New London ferry terminal by 7am Wednesday morning? If so, you can join us for 36 at Fishers Island.”

I’d be lying if I said that was the response I was expecting.

And the answer is? Of course. Absolutely, I will do everything I need to do to be at that ferry dock.

Getting to Fishers Island Club

The reality was a little more complicated than I’d hoped.

I got about 3 hours of sleep before hopping a cab in Brooklyn around 1:30am to head to Penn Station.

I boarded an Amtrak to New London which got me there around 4:30 in the morning. 


A deserted train station.

I then slept on a bench until about 6:30, when my friends arrived and we boarded the ferry with their car in tow.

We visited Fishers in late September after the summer crowds had left the island.

And I’ve gotta say, it’s kind of a surreal experience.

We stopped at a local convenience store to load up on coffee and snacks, and you definitely get the vibe that the island is from a different era.

It’s unlike any place I’ve visited. There’s an understatedness to the whole island, and if you’re an outsider? You kind of feel like an outsider.

When we arrived at the Club, there were hardly any people there and the skies were a dark grey overcast. Not exactly what you hope to see when playing an oceanside bucket list course. Little did we know what we were in for.

Playing Fishers Island Club

Fishers Island Club is often touted as one of the most difficult tee times in the country to get. And it’s not hard to see why. Some well-known, top 100 courses feel kind of like a factory.

Merion is a great example. Merion is one of my all-time favorite courses, and days of golf. But it feels like the majority of the play on the East is guest play.

A place like Fishers on the other hand feels like a special place, that’s truly for their members. 


Fishers Island Club Eden
The wonderful Eden hole at Fishers Island.
I’ve even heard stories of them writing a letter to the editors of Golf Magazine asking to be removed from their top 100 list.

In 2021 it’s a little bit harder for any Club to stay under the radar, but they’ve done a pretty good job.

This is in large part due to the undertaking it takes to get there.

You’re not just going to swing by the club and take some photos from the outside looking in.

If you’re making it all the way out to Fishers Island, chances are, you’ve got a tee time.

Fortunately, that was the case for me. 

We played unaccompanied, didn’t set foot in the clubhouse, and due to the fog I’ll mention below, didn’t even really get to see that much of the course.


Yet it’s one of the most special days of golf I’ve ever had.

Fishers Island Club: The Course

Fishers Island was designed by Seth Raynor in 1926. It’s short by modern standards at a reasonable 6,556 yards, but this is just fine by me. As a 12 handicap, anything longer than that simply means my score will be that much higher.

It features many of the template holes that Raynor and his mentor C.B. Macdonald are known for, and in some cases, has some of the very best examples of these holes you’ll find in golf.

But when you head to the first tee and stare out at the first fairway, it all feels, well, very unassuming.

Looking out at the first hole, you’ll likely see what feels like a big (sometimes brown) field.

Fishers Island Club
The opening hole at Fishers.
There isn’t much in the way of fairway irrigation at Fishers, so you’ll often find some discoloration and firm, fast playing conditions.

To the point, I’ve heard people complain about the conditioning at the club.

Sure it might not be the tight lines and bright green you see when watching the Masters, but the approach to maintenance is very fitting with the course.

Understated.

Timeless.

A focus on how it plays over how it looks.

And believe me, you’ll have plenty of pretty things to look at when you’re playing a round at Fishers Island.

It’s also worth noting, the conditions were fantastic during our trip there.

Once you get to the second hole you start to get an idea of what’s to come.

You can see Long Island Sound out in the distance, and you’re treated to one of the most famous template holes: the Redan, modeled after the 15th at North Berwick.

The Redan at Fishers Island is much less severe than examples you might see at Yale, National, or Somerset Hills – but is still a great version of the hole.

Fishers Island Club
The redan.

And then as you make your way to the third green of the “Plateau” hole, you begin to see why Fishers Island has become so revered in the golf community. 

Fishers Island Club
“Plateau”
It isn’t due to an ostentatious clubhouse, tournament pedigree, or high price tag. 


In fact, I have zero clue how much it costs to be a member at the Club – but I’d guess it isn’t nearly as much as you’d think it is for a place of this stature.

But good luck getting an invite to join. 

No, what makes Fishers special is world-class Golden Age golf holes, set against a pristine, remote backdrop.

It’s like Mid Ocean Club on steroids. Who’d expect to see a course built by such a famous architect, in the 20s, on an island 600 miles from any other land?

Fishers, despite being closer to land, feels even more remote. And many of its holes, are even more impressive than those at MOC.

Five treats you to what might be the best biarritz hole I’ve ever played. Certainly the most beautiful.



The 7th, “Latimer” hole became a running joke with our group.


It’s a signature hole on a course full of signature holes, the running line became:

“Man, what an incredible Latimer hole this is. Best in the world.”

As far as I know, this is the only “Latimer” hole in the world.

Fishers Island Hole 7
You could argue the 7th “Latimer” hole is the Signature Hole at Fishers Island.



Speaking of best in the world, the “Double Plateau” 9th green is in the running for one my favorite greens in the world.

If you asked me to name my favorite, rapid-fire without thinking about it, this would likely be my answer.

Fishers Island Double Plateau
The 9th green, “Double Plateau.” I love this green so much.
As you make your way around Fishers you might find yourself occasionally feeling out of breath.

For what is a relatively flat island, there’s a surprising amount of elevation change on the course.

Much of this is brilliantly worked into the hole design, like on the wonderful 1oth “Knoll” hole with a steep walk up to the green.

Bad Weather at Fishers Island

Unfortunately, as you can tell from my photos of the day, the weather wasn’t on our side during my one visit here.

The plus is that it didn’t rain.

The minus is that, we couldn’t really see much. At all.

The exception was about a 30-minute window during our second round, where we saw some blue sky, and I was able to get great views of the 11th – 14th holes.

A look back at the 12th from the 14th green.


However, the fog did nothing to dampen our spirits.

After all, rounds like this don’t come around all that often (for most of us), so I was determined to enjoy every second of it.

Final Thoughts on Fishers Island

If I had to compare Fishers Island to one other course I’ve played, it would be Maidstone.

Obviously, this is another very exclusive place, but there are some similar vibes on the course.

Both are from a different era. They aren’t long. They’ve got some quirk to them. They’re ok if the fairways aren’t a lush green. They’ve got insane views. And despite very well-heeled memberships, everything on the course feels understated.


The “Cape” Hole.


With most rounds I play I feel like I can get excited for the next time I’ll be back.

But with Fishers Island? I legitimately don’t know if I’ll ever have the opportunity again.

It’s a small membership, it’s about as hard to get to as any course in America, and with so many people clamoring to play it these days, I imagine it will make opportunities to do so that much more difficult.

But I’m thankful for the chance I had to visit. 

Golf is such a special game. It takes you to places you’d never expect to visit with people you’d be unlikely to meet otherwise. 

Fishers Island Club
A foggy memory.


As I got in the car, and boarded the ferry, and waited for the train, and endured the 3 hour ride, and hopped on the subway to go back to Brooklyn – I thought about all of this.

About how a 24-hour whirlwind journey to a tiny island, thousands of miles from my home, to hit a little white ball around a waterfront field, became one of the most memorable days of my life.

And when you have the opportunity to visit Fishers Island Club? I imagine it will become one of the most memorable of yours as well.

Thomas Jr.,1927,Los Angeles (North),top100golfcourses,rev019_la_north_1,"The location for the Los Angeles Country Club makes it possibly one of the most valuable pieces of real estate in the world. It’s therefore fitting that the North course does full justice to the land because it is a truly magnificent layout.

The club was founded in 1897 as the Los Angeles Golf Club, moving locations three times before settling on its current site adjacent to Beverly Hills in 1911. The original club founders, Joe Sartori and Ed Tufts, along with Norman Macbeth and Charles Orr, laid out the inaugural course at the new Wilshire site.

The course (now known as the North) at the renamed Los Angeles Country Club was refashioned by Herbert Fowler in 1921 but re-routed in 1927 by George C. Thomas Jr. and his right-hand man, William Bell, with excellent effect. Fast-forward to the new millennium when Gil Hanse was entrusted to restore this classic course to its former glory.

The layout is at once thrilling and often exciting with its hills, ridges, swales and valleys. There are two 18-hole courses, the North and the South, if you can get a game, but only have time for one round, try and persuade your friendly member to play the North course.

There are far too many great holes to mention them all, but the par threes are exceptionally strong, exactingly long and noteworthy. The 7th is perhaps the toughest of them all, measuring almost 240 yards where only the perfect tee shot will find the sanctuary of the green. The 9th is perhaps the signature hole, with the clubhouse as the backdrop, but many members consider the 11th to be the star of the show with downtown LA as the backdrop.

As far as parkland courses go, Los Angeles North is as good as it comes. The course holds your interest all the way round and it’s a challenging and tough but fair layout. Roll this up with a beautiful setting (except perhaps for the odd imposing tower block) and you have a little piece of heaven."
20,Los Angeles (North),top100,"Los Angeles, CA",George C. Thomas Jr.,1927,"Los Angeles Country Club (Los Angeles, California)",Bill Satterfield,rev020_la_north_2,"Los Angeles Country Club is a historic club dating back to 1897 with the famous North course being developed in 1921. The club's first course was the 18 hole South course which ends up playing second fiddle to the championship North course. The USGA has begged LACC for years to host a U.S. Open or other major event but the elite membership has continually turned them down. The George Thomas design is first rate and features nice elevation changes while the William Bell bunkers are visually appealing yet still penilizing. It is a classic walkable course that represents one of the best parkland courses in America.

Individual Hole Analysis
Signature Hole:  11th Hole – 244 Yard Par 3 – Easily the signature hole of the course and one of the best par 3s anywhere. In fact, some years ago Golf Digest rated it the 23rd best par three in America.

11th Hole at Los Angeles Country Club (244 Yard Par 3)
Best Par 3:  11th Hole – 244 Yards – There is no arguing that the reverse Redan 11th at LACC is not only the best par 3 at the North course, but one of the best in the world. All the par 3s at Los Angles Country Club's North Course have a significant amount of length to them, but the 11th gives golfers the opportunity to fly the ball a shorter distance and utilize the slope that funnels into the green.

11th Hole at Los Angeles Country Club (244 Yard Par 3)
Best Par 4:  3rd Hole – 385 Yards – A barranca protects the left side of the hole and leads into a plateau portion of the very contoured fairway at this uphill hole. From there, an intimidating shot over a William Bell bunker that fronts of the green is required in order to find the putting surface. In the picture below you can see the Los Angeles skyline look back towards the tee box from behind the green.

3rd Hole at Los Angeles Country Club (385 Yard Par 4)
Best Par 5:  8th Hole – 561 Yards – A barranca disects the fairway and creates two separate alleys to play through. Given the angles of the fairway and placement of the trees, this hole becomes a true three-shot hole that features a cascading second fairway and 30 yard deep green. Utilizing the barranca throughout the design is one of Thomas' strong points at LACC and the golfer seems some of his best work at the 8th.

8th Hole at Los Angeles Country Club (561 Yard Par 5)
Birdie Time:  6th Hole – 340 Yard Par 4 – An excellent risk/reward opportunity is afforded to the golfer at the short 6th hole. A barranca encircles the green like a mote protecting a castle and strikes fear into the golfer banging on his driver in hopes of finding the green, or a short chip. The 90 degree dogleg right hole requires a 225 carry just to catch a view of the green on a safe line straight off the tee box. But the stories on this hole never have been told about the guy that took the safe line . . .

6th Hole at Los Angeles Country Club (340 Yard Par 4)
Bogey Beware:  13th Hole – 453 Yard Par 4 – At 453 yards this two-shotter protected by six bunkers is tough enough, but the real difficulty is the mental distraction the golfer has as he realizes the Playboy Mansion sits beyond the trees behind the green. Uphill all the way to the green, try to stay focused on the task at hand and not the distraction beyond the tall fence."
21,Pebble Beach,top100,"Pebble Beach, CA",Jack Neville/Douglas Grant,1919,PEBBLE BEACH - 18 POINTS,David Jones,rev021_pebble_1,"Trying to play golf at some of the best courses in America can be a frustrating experience. Yes, we all know that you can't get a round on Augusta but it seems there are more courses that you can't get a game on than you can. Pebble Beach therefore is a great exception - it's the top rated 'public' course in the USA and while it may be eye-watering expensive at least gives the chance to walk in the steps of legends that so many of us used to playing in Europe take for granted.

The practice putting green was running fast and true so expectations were high on the first tee. Our caddie tried to point me to the gold tees and my friend to the back blues due to our differing handicaps but call us old-fashioned, we decided to both play the same ones. The first hole was a massive disappointment. The fairway was very heavily sanded - and the green was a temporary! Bear in mind this was the most expensive round of golf I had ever paid for. No-one had told us about the condition of the course when booking or before teeing off - ludicrous. I would suggest anyone considering playing asks beforehand what condition the course is in........

The first few holes are nondescript and really do feel like any American country club course. Cart paths, roads and houses making up the most notable features. Now, I should say I played this course some years ago and probably hadn't read up on the course a huge amount before playing. Maybe I would have enjoyed it more with a little preparation but it was a little bit of an underwhelming start.

From there though as you go out to the water the holes are clearly special. The par 5 6th is intimidating on the tee but actually quite playable. By the time we got to the signature par 3 7th the wind was up and yardages were not really much use. A punchy knock down was the order of the day which my partner managed. I put a gap wedge in the air and paid the price as the wind brought it back into the sand. 8 is a fantastic hole - the approach shot over a canyon truly spectacular and the par I got there will stay with me for a long time. 9 and 10 both are wonderful holes, mainly because of the setting, before going back inland.

Golf World go behind the scenes at Pebble Beach Golf Links.

This stretch is probably better than the first few inland holes but you are back in a (very nice) housing estate. The green on the par 5 14th was a bit ridiculous - after coming 572 yards it is pretty small and very angled. 17 and 18 are simply a great finishing two holes and are well documented elsewhere! The wind was up and 17 was playing a rescue for me. 18 is just a wonderful walk up, spoilt for me by a 4 putt to shoot 92. Still, I was an 18 handicapper when I played there so 2 over handicap from the back tees at Pebble was satisfactory!

As an experience Pebble was pretty good. Everyone was friendly and the caddy just fine. The day was slightly spoilt by the sanded fairways and very inconsistent greens. Some were slow, some were fast and it was a question of having a guess when you got there.

But I couldn't help feeling that there wasn't as much 'special' at Pebble Beach as I had hoped for and seen in the true great courses. The holes on the ocean make the course, but the rest are at times nondescript. The round we had was a long one - almost 6 hours - and it felt like we were in a bit of a money-making machine.

Overall though I'm glad we played it. We enjoyed the views and there were some memories there to savour but I imagine there are courses with lesser reputations which will beat this when it comes to my all-time favourite courses. Still, at least you can get a round here without having to been one of the US elite so that's something.

 

BOOKING THE COURSE

Ah, welcome to the money making machine which is Pebble Beach.  Since I played there inflation has hit hard and the green fee for 18 holes at Pebble Beach is a staggering $625 plus cart fee and/or caddie fee. However, booking a tee time is far from straightforward for this much famed ‘public’ course. Because, you see, only guests of the hotel can book a tee time more than 24 hours out. Therefore if you want to guarantee a time on the course you need to stay there. Oh and there’s more, a minimum of a 2 night stay is required to book a round on Pebble – this rises to 3 nights at peak times. Now there are other courses there but given the cheapest room is normally around $1100 a night this is a fabulously expensive trip.

What I should say however, is that the rules seem to be broken. We called up about a week in advance and they gave us a tee time. Maybe that was because the course was pretty roughed up at the time and it would be harder in the peak months but it’s worth a go. You can get a sense of what availability looks like here.

TOUR TIPS

If you do make it to Pebble I would really encourage you to watch a few highlight reels from US Opens gone by to really appreciate the history as you go around. I visited in 1992 as a student when Tom Kite won in the winds and rain and it is just one of the many highlights from over the years worth having a look at.

We stayed in Carmel for a week and there is plenty to do around the area – great drives, the Monterey aquarium, amazing beaches. It’s only a couple of hours south of San Francisco but it was a few years ago now and much will have changed so instead of giving any real local tips, here’s some thoughts of other courses to play in the area..

The Links at Spanish Bay – Part of the Pebble Beach estate. We played it early one morning and it was a 14 at best. Lots of random red stakes everywhere and tight as anything. Avoid!!

Pacific Grove – A local course which I would play every time ahead of Spanish Bay. Can't complain at all for $35! The first 9 were nothing special but the condition was pretty good and pace of play not too bad. The holes were pretty short and very playable. The back 9 opened up on the ocean fantastically - really lovely holes that with the 40 mph wind were playing really tricky. I had a 360 yard drive on one par 4 to the green followed by 200 yards into the wind at the next."
22,Pebble Beach,top100,"Pebble Beach, CA",Jack Neville/Douglas Grant,1919,Review: Pebble Beach Golf Links,Andrew Harvie,rev022_pebble_2,"Given the high-profile nature of Pebble Beach Golf Links, it becomes difficult to present this review as anything other than a typical walkthrough of one of the three most famous golf courses in the world (alongside Augusta National and The Old Course). However, my first and only round at Pebble Beach in December 2023 left a lot to be uncovered by being on property. Sure, hundreds of rounds on my Playstation or Trackman, and the numerous US Open’s and the regular occurrence of the AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am yearly on the TOUR meant I knew ~roughly what I was getting into. Yet, the old Jack Neville and Douglas Grant design unveiled enough to make me compelled to write a good ‘ol fashioned review.

This opening hole, to such an esteemed golf course, is one that leaves quite a bit to be desired. In truth, it would be among the least exciting holes of any Top 20 golf course in America. A simple tee shot, with less-than-driver to the corner of this sub-400 yard par 4 from the back tees is a fairly mundane opening shot.


I did appreciate the approach shot’s difficulty given the short nature of the hole. Bailing out left off the tee means a longer shot, while everyone plays from a right-handed hanging lie. The greens at Pebble are notoriously small, and this one lives up the hype: not a lot of room for missing, but if you ought to miss, dumping it in the bunker right is the best play. I found this green to be relatively mush, but the back portion features a bit of interest.


Much is made about the dichotomy between the oceanside and inland holes at Pebble Beach, notably the sharp contrast in quality. Granted, it would be difficult for any golf course or property to follow up the stretch from the 4th through the 10th, but the 2nd is a standout inland. At 509 yards, this hole is a converted par 4 for the US Open, but for resort guests, a short par 5 awaits.


What TV won’t show you is the severity of this fairway, which slopes pretty hard towards the ocean on the right. Ideally, one aims at the right edge of the left bunker and gravity will take the ball to the centre. In my group, two people landed at the right edge of the right greenside bunkers (above) with a slight fade and they ended up in the bunkers on the right—cool!

For those laying up, it is a relatively straightforward shot as long as you play short of the (great hazard? Barranca?) trench running east-west on the line of play about 100 yards from the green.


Said trench from the layup area. The two cypress trees left and right make it a very precise layup, something I feel is missed in the modern game.


At 397 yards, the 3rd was the hole I was most curious about given how awkward it is on Trackman. A sharp dogleg left tumbling down the hill towards the ocean across that same trench/barranca, I found this to be a thrilling golf hole and woefully overlooked against the ocean holes. The tee shot tempts the golfer to smash it over the trees if possible, but if not, out to the right and having a hard approach shot from a very difficult downhill right-handed hook lie awaits.


What you have to negotiate with off the tee:


A fairly straightforward approach shot, if not for the difficult lie under the golfer’s feat awaits.


The 4th is the start of a brilliant stretch of oceanside golf, with the Pacific Ocean flanking the entire stretch from the 4th-10th on the right side. The 333 yard two-shot hole is shockingly uphill in person, and probably one of the biggest surprises against the preconceived notions of Pebble Beach prior to playing.


One thing that was disappointing is the mow lines following the US Women’s Open, which have been brought in from the left so that left pot-ish bunker is not a centreline bunker. The entire strategy of the hole benefits those playing out to the right closer to the ocean with the green canted to the right, but losing that fairway feels like a big miss. Nonetheless, a classy hole with a very uphill approach shot tough to control in the coastal winds.


Decent view from here, too:


The 189 yard par 3, 5th is a new Jack Nicklaus par 3, where the old hole played more directly towards the 6th tee. Essentially, you would play away from the ocean, rather than parallel to it as you do now. There are reverse redan elements, but I found this to be a bit of a letdown par 3 given how small the green is.


It is obviously an improvement over the old product… until you have to walk back to the 6th tee. However! The old hole looks rather, vanilla, so I can appreciate Jack’s interest in creating something unique, and I do think it has its own individualistic identity within the set of one-shot holes.

Beginning with the 498 yard par 5, 6th, the stretch ending at the 10th is likely the singular best four-hole stretch in golf. If it isn’t, I cannot wait to find it! When I played, the tee shot was slightly botched given the new mow lines make the ocean a long way right, but I was a bit surprised how narrow the chute between the bunkers and the Pacific was. A difficult tee shot, and one you NEED to get in the fairway.


TV cameras and video games do not do this second shot justice. It is so severely uphill it is hard to believe in person, and is a true thrill to hit in person. Hit and hope!


Here is a picture for scale of two average sized men:


The open nature of the green and the ground welcomes the running shot, meaning those going for it have the thrill of getting home in two looming over them with a good approach (if they can get it over the cliff).


The 107 yard par 3, 7th, in all its glory:


One thing about Pebble Beach that is somewhat of an annoyance is the green complexes. While they are small and that’s cool, there is very little contour in them, meaning a majority of the putts on any round are primarily flat. The same issue is prevalent at Bethpage Black, where the layout is absolutely awesome, but the green complexes are rather mundane and dare I say boring. If you expanded them out 20% and added a bit more contour in the spirit of the original golf course, I suspect Pebble would jump back into the Top 10 in the United States… likely where it belongs and should get back to.

At 416 yards, the 8th is a beefy golf hole given the forced layup of about 250 or so yards from the back tee. This is a difficult tee shot to figure out where to go, I know I had no idea. I hit it over the corner of the fescue on the left and was in the middle of the fairway, but with proper mow lines, the eye gets pulled pretty far right.


The approach to the 8th, as difficult as cool as advertised… and quite downhill.


For those laying up or unable to make it on the direct route, there is room left to bail out. The price of admission is worth it alone for this singular hole. Sublime!


A cool look back shows how dramatic the approach shot is:


The ninth hole is an absolute terror-infused 483 yards, with a very severe fairway waiting balls that land in the fairway. Anything between the bunkers on the left of the 9th fairway and the left edge of the bunkers in the distance at the 10th is a great line. Like the 6th and 8th, getting the ball in the fairway is paramount to the success of playing this hole properly. There are few golf courses that demand such accuracy, and the rough was not long!


From a right-handed hanging downhill lie, this is among the more difficult approach shots you will ever hit. That ocean might be out to the right, but it is MUCH more in play than it looks.


I wish I would have played the 444 yard par 4, 10th from the original tee down on the right, but I suspect that is likely frowned upon. Regardless, the 10th’s fairway is severely sloped to the right, rewarding a tee shot just right of the bunkers up the left. Another spectacular hole, but a (very) small step down against the 8th and 9th.


Another difficult approach from the consistent hanging lie, though this one has a bit of room to run the ball in, at least for those who challenge the ocean up the right.


I suggest taking a look back from behind the 10th green to admire the stretch of coastline golf you just played.


There is a fair amount of discourse about the merits of the 370 yard par 4, 11th and how it follows the stretch of golf along the coast, but I actually enjoyed this hole. Most great golf courses are anything but prototypical, and the 11th is that unusual spice that makes it what it is. A tee shot left of the mansion is ideal. For those keeping track, this is the third blind tee shot in four holes—I, for one, love the funk!


The severe uphill nature of the hole continues on the approach shot, and also plays to a severe back-to-front green. Finally, a green that makes me feel something!


The 12th is an abysmal 202 yard par 3. Playing slightly downhill, this… THIS, is the letdown after a pretty brilliant stretch of golf. I am not certain now anyone over a 3 index plays this hole, but good on you if you can. The green is likely too small and the sand splash coming from the bunker short left makes it borderline impossible to get it close without a 130 foot apex.


I loved the 401 yard par 4, 13th, another severe fairway but the first hole since the 3rd that it features a right-handed hook lie. I enjoyed the green here as well, with the back right portion being pretty demanding but the opening in the front allowing the higher-handicap to get it close. Anyways, from the back tee, getting it over the bunker jutting in on the left is not a cakewalk, so I imagine if the wind was different I would have to play out right and let the slope funnel the ball around the bunker.


A pretty neat, yet demanding uphill approach with everything dramatically sloping towards the Pacific Ocean on the left.


The 14th is a bit of a slog at 559 yards, turning uphill and to the right around the course’s boundary. The tee shot is unusual: unlike the 9th or 11th, where the achievement is simply avoiding choas on the opening swing, there are bunkers littering the landing area, meaning repeat plays are probably preferred to be able to figure out the exact line.


The aforementioned bunkers:


Good for you if you can get home in two here, most can;t, meaning this layup is rather lame.


The cypress tree on the right was a surprise, pushing most to the left of the fairway meaning the massive greenside bunker short left comes into play more. Kinda neat in that respect, but if you can get it down far enough, it doesn’t really matter. Even from the right, the false front right of the greenside bunker is equally as difficult.


I have a lot of time for the 393 yard par 4, 15th, a very fun tee shot to slam down the hillside with the bunkering up the left lingering.


The bunkering does make this a fairly difficult tee shot, but getting it down far enough means it likely won’t matter too much. I wonder if anyone has ever gotten into the greenside bunkers with their tee shots… I was about 65 yards from the front edge, and there are much longer players than me. I asked the two caddies in my group but they didn’t know. Someone call Kyle Birkshire!


The approach is relatively straightforward, but this is a subtle, good green.

I also loved the 400 yard par 4, 16th, which was likely the inland hole I was most excited to see prior to playing. Anything left of the Cypress Tree centre frame is ideal. The fairway does pinch pretty aggressively, so three wood or even less might be the play if it was firmer.


This approach shot is gorgeous, splitting the two cypress trees with some pretty artistic bunkering short.


If anything, I felt the famed 182 yard penultimate hole at Pebble Beach to be a slight letdown, mostly held up by history and its proximity to the Pacific Ocean. I think it’s a ~fine golf hole, but nothing more really. In general, the par 3’s at Pebble Beach are shockingly weak considering the status of the golf course, with only the 7th being a standout and largely off its location, not off its architectural merits.


The green’s shape was cool though!


The 18th was anything but a disappointment however, and a worthy finish to any golf course (but especially Pebble Beach). Credit where its due, English architect Herbert Strong extended the hole by some 200 yards, turning it into the par 5 it is today. At 541 yards, the hole is just reachable enough that playing closer to the Pacific means you might stand a chance at getting greenside in two, but just long enough that bailing out right makes it a tougher three-shot hole.


Anything left of the tree is pretty good. Missing right means you have to negociate with it (like I had to).


The green is small, but I think a good tee shot would allow the chance to get home in two if you were aggressive up the left. The bunkering against the sea wall makes the layup pretty awkward, especially trying to avoid the tree overhanging the right bunkers.


Is Pebble the single best public golf course in the United States? Probably not in my mind. For starters, the green complexes, especially in contrast to a Pinehurst No. 2 or Pacific Dunes, are lacking and among the top 20 golf courses in America, likely the least interesting set around. With that being said, it might be the most exciting golf course I’ve played tee-to-green, and for that, Pebble still deserves the utmost recognition among the world of golf.

Lots has been made about the price of a green fee here, and more specifically, if it is worth it. AT $625 USD, I would say yes, but if the rumours are true about the $1,000 green fee in 2025, likely not at that rate, especially if I could, in theory, play all five golf courses in two days at Bandon for that price (first round full price, second round half, third round free).


With all that being said, Pebble Beach is still epic, but I wish Pebble Beach Company would explore a restoration to bring back some of the classic features lost. If that happened, who knows how high Pebble would rank… for now, I think it is on the outside of the top 10-15 looking in."
23,Pinehurst (No. 2),top100,"Village of Pinehurst, NC",Donald Ross,1907,Pinehurst No. 2: Donald Ross’ Crowning Achievement,Sean Ogle,rev023_pinehurst_1,"I thought my golf season was over for the year – or at least the quest for top 100 courses.

That is until I got an email inviting me to a business conference in Charlotte, North Carolina in October.

It’d prove to be easy to tack onto the end of my trip to New York City, so I figured why not.


Of course, that easy two days quickly devolved into a full week after I realized that Pinehurst was a short 2 hour drive from where I’d be staying.

Simply put Pinehurst #2 is one of the most famous and history-rich courses in the world. It’s hosted nearly every major tournament and considering both the men and women’s US Opens were played just a few months before, it seemed like the perfect time to make the trip over.

I honestly wasn’t totally sure what to expect. I’d only played a couple rounds of golf ever in the Southeast, and I really knew nothing about what the town would be like.

The night before I was to switch over to my room at the Carolina Hotel I was at the Best Western in Southern Pines. A perfectly fine hotel for those on a budget, but it simply didn’t compare to what I’d soon be experiencing at the Carolina.

It was a short 10 minute drive to get to Pinehurst, but once there it felt a world away.  I was leaving strip mall central and then winding my way through neighborhoods trying to find the hotel.

Then out of nowhere I took a left hand turn and was greeted by the famous “Pinehurst” shrub in front of the hotel.

Carolina Hotel


Sidenote: There must be a higher concentration of golf courses within 20 minutes of Pinehurst, than anywhere else in the world. They. Are. Everywhere.

For some reason I had it in my head that the resort would be a little more like Bandon in the sense that once you’re in the resort, you’re in. Not the case. The resort and courses of Pinehurst seamlessly blend in with the small community around it – if I had to draw a comparison, it was probably more similar to Blackwolf Run and Kohler than any of the other golf destinations I’ve been to.

I got checked into the beautiful hotel, and was greeted with extraordinarily friendly service everywhere I went (must be a southern thing).

I hopped the shuttle to make the short transfer over to the main clubhouse where courses #1-5 sat.

Walking through the clubhouse was like getting a history lesson, seeing the photos, memorabilia and everything else that goes along with having so much history attached to the place.

After checking in and walking out of the pro shop, I strolled around the back of the clubhouse taking it in. The putting green, the Payne Stewart statue, the first tee.

Anytime I play a new course, especially one as highly revered as Pinehurst #2, you can’t help but get a little giddy.

I’ve traveled all over the world, and while I won’t say I’m jaded by any means, I have found that playing a new course like this gets me more excited than just about anything else.

I can only imagine how it’ll feel once I finally get to play the likes of Augusta or Cypress 🙂

I also learned that Pinehurst is actually a country club. I didn’t realize that there was a membership component to the course, but it was pretty clear it was due to the “members only” section of the deck at the back of the clubhouse.

I hit the range and then headed to the practice green where I met the three other guys I’d be playing with.  One of them was a sales guy and a pretty decent golfer. The other two were separate clients he’d just signed – and neither of them looked like they’d played golf in years – if ever.


At least I wouldn’t be the worst person on the course today, I thought to myself.

Little did I know just how special of a day it would end up being.

The Front Nine at Pinehurst No. 2

The other gentlemen I was playing with elected to take a cart, which I thought to be the stupidest decision of all time.

You’re playing #2 for the first (probably only) time ever, and the course is cart path only. So not only do you spend just as much (if not more) time walking than me, but you miss out on a large part of the experience.

I elected to take a caddie, which I rarely do if I don’t have to, but I felt it only appropriate. And it was a great decision, as he was excellent, and easily shaved some strokes off my round.

Hole 1 (Par 4, 375 yards)

Not wanting to embarrass myself, I left the driver in the bag and stepped up to the tee with my three wood, the length on the first isn’t it’s major defense.


Right down the middle.

The hole is deceptively difficult as the fairway closes with bunkers right around the landing area.  As was the case with many of the courses I played in the region, all the bunkers on the course were played as waste bunkers -and thus, you could ground your club.

I left my 6 iron to 15 feet, and as I walked up to the green I could see exactly what made this course so famous – and diabolical. The entire outside of the green sloped from the center out. Meaning, if you didn’t hit your spot – you’re screwed.

I asked my caddie if all the greens were this tough and he just said “psh, this an easy one.”

Great.

I walked off feeling ecstatic about me par.

Pinehurst 2 - Hole 1


Hole 2 (Par 4, 410 yards)

The second is one of the most difficult holes on one of the most difficult courses you’ll find.

During the open it could stretch to over 500 yards…as a par 4.

It’s far too easy to find yourself in the trees or the waste bunker on the left off the tee, and if you are you’ll have a tough time making par.

Pinehurst 2 - Hole 2 Pinehurst 2 - Hole 2 Approach


Hole 3 (Par 4, 317 yards)

I really liked the third hole.

A short par 4 with a dogleg right to an elevated green. However, take one look at the green complex, and you’ll be intimidating.

The green is narrow and wide, and it just looks like it slopes off in every direction.

I knew that I’d be having the golf gods looking down on me during the round after I left my approach in the right bunker, then hitting out of the san my ball hit the pin and dropped down to a foot away – allowing me to save my par.

Pinehurst 2 - Hole 3


Hole 4 (Par 5, 482 yards)

There was a little confusion on the course as to whether the 4th was a par 4 or par 5. The reality is that for the championships it was changed from a par 5 to a par 4. And the 5th was changed from a par 4 to a par 5.

I’m still not sure what this one technically was when I played it…

Either way, despite radically different scenery, this hole reminded me of the 14th at Trump International. It’s obvious which one would have influenced the other, but with the tee position, elevation, and bunkering there were many resemblances.

The main defense here was a tricky green that sloped hard right to left.

Pinehurst 2 - Hole 4 Pinehurst 2 - Hole 4 Approach


Hole 5 (Par 4, 431 yards)

Long known as one of the most fearsome par 4s in the game, I found it to be a very tame par 5.

Note: We played this around 480 yards, and I believe as a par 5. However, I’m still unsure…

This would be true for many of the par 5s at Pinehurst #2 actually.

I recently heard Tiger Woods talking about how the course is a great example of a course that can be tremendously difficult for the pros, but still totally playable for the amateur.

I won’t lie, the course was not nearly as difficult as I was expecting it to be – playing from the white tees of 6300 yards. Yes the greens were pretty intimidating, but I was able to go for it in 2 on nearly all of the par 5s – which I wasn’t expecting.

After leaving my approach 3 wood short in the bunker, I chipped it up to 10 feet and left myself with another tap in par. Something that was a bit of a theme for the first half of the round.

Pinehurst 2 - Hole 5


Hole 6 (Par 3, 179 yards)

The 6th is a long par 3 with a large green and two massive waste bunkers on either side of it. One cool feature is the fact that the tee box backs up right against the new back teebox for #4. Looking down the 4th fairway from there really puts into perspective how much longer the course can be when the pros play it.

Pinehurst 2 - Hole 6


Hole 7 (Par 4, 377 yards)

The 7th is a sharp dogleg right, and depending on where you put your drive, you can have a considerable carry over the waste bunkers at the corner. These were all new during the recent renovation, and my short 3 wood wasn’t nearly enough to even get close to thinking about making it over any of them off the tee.

With wider fairways than it used to have, driver may have been the play – but either way I still walked away with a solid par.

Pinehurst 2 - Hole 7 Approach Small

Fun fact: There’s a HUGE house on the 7th fairway that is owned by the CEO of a Fortune 500 company. My caddie said the place get’s used once a year at most. More interesting than that though is the fact the guy bought part of the outfield wall from Yankee Stadium and it now sits in his driveway.

I couldn’t help but sneak over to take a photo…

D71_8224


Hole 8 (Par 5, 457 yards)

The par 5 8th is another example of a par 5 that just seemed way too easy. It only measured 456 yards, and was basically just a straight shot uphill to the green.

At this point I had a pretty good score going, and I left my second shot just short of the green and proceeded to three putt it from there. I still made par, but being that close on a par 5 and not walking away with better was frustrating.

Pinehurst 2 - Hole 8


Hole 9 (Par 3, 151 yards)

For some reason this was the hole that’s always stuck out in my mind.  The par 3 9th was the one that I was most excited to play, and walking up to it, I was also only three over and feeling pretty great about the round so far.

It’s not a long hole at only 148 yards from where we were, but the bunkering and green undulation is easily some of the most severe you’ll see on the course.

I stepped up, hit my shot, and I swear I thought it was going to go in the hole. It was right in line with the pin, and it looked like a tap in birdie from the tee.

The reality was it was about 10 feet out, and I missed the putt – but once again, I’ll take tap in pars all day long on a course like this.

Pinehurst 2 - Hole 9 Small


The Back Nine at Pinehurst No. 2

Hole 10 (Par 5, 469 yards)

This is another example of someone up above looking down on me. As I made the turn with a 39 on the front, I couldn’t help but say to myself “how cool would it be to break 80 on Pinehurst #2?!”

I stepped up to the tee of what ended up being another remarkably short dogleg left par 5, and what did I do? Duck hooked it, hard into the trees to the left.

As I turned around to walk back, my caddie just starts laughing.

“Clean living, man.”

“What?”

“Your ball hit the tree and bounced back out to the middle of the fairway”

My second shot was a three wood just to the right of the green and I chipped up and two-putted for par.

It’s worth noting some of these holes play much longer if you step back to the blue tees, in this case it would be a 100 yards farther back…

Pinehurst 2 - Hole 10


Hole 11 (Par 4, 368 yards)

Ben Hogan reportedly called the 11th one of his favorite par 4s, and with the recent restoration, it was restored to the way it looked and played back in his day.

A mid-length to long par 4 (depending on the tees), it has a feature found on many of the holes at Pinehurst #2 in that the green is just slightly off center of the fairway. You rarely have a straight shot to the green.  It’s often slightly off to the right, and surrounded by bunkers, forcing you to think a little bit more about what shot you’re going to hit.

They’ve added waste bunker all down the right, and while it was relatively tame during my time there, I can only imagine how scary they let it get for the majors.

Pinehurst 2 - Hole 11


Hole 12 (Par 4, 351 yards)

Remember that slightly off-center green we talked about at 11? Well, 12 has the same thing, but much more pronounced.

Ideally, you’ll want to find the right side of the fairway for the shortest approach. Be careful not to go long on that shot either, because the back of the green has a pretty tight lie and significant run off the back – as I learned the hard way.

I had my first double in awhile, and I could slowly feel the round slipping away from me.

Pinehurst 2 - Hole 12 Green

Hole 13 (Par 4, 356 yards)

I found 13 to be a welcome change of pace.

So far the back nine had been great, but 13 added a little bit of elevation and visual interest to the course.



A dogleg right with a significantly elevated green that sweeps back a bit to the left, this hole had a little hint of Tobacco Road in it which I really enjoyed.

Pinehurst 2 - Hole 13

Hole 14 (Par 4, 400 yards)

It was right around this time that we realized just how slow we’d really been playing.  Our caddie told us we had about an hour of light left, and honestly, at that point I was about ready to forge ahead from my group (as there was no one in front of us anymore).

But we all agreed to pick it up a bit, and I crossed my fingers.

14 is one of those holes where you really feel like you can step up and rip it. It’s a straightaway par 4, but as with many of the holes, you need to be wary of bunker outcroppings around the landing area.

Pinehurst 2 - Hole 14



Hole 15 (Par 3, 169 yards)

The first par 3 on the backside, the 15th is a straight forward par 3 with a large round green, and some deep menacing bunkers flanking it. However like most of the holes here, Ross’ signature crowned greens are in full force, waiting to knock your ball off the dance floor.

Overall with the exception of #9, I was slightly underwhelmed by the par 3s on the course. Sure, there was nothing wrong with them, but I felt they lacked a bit of interest and wow factor.

Pinehurst 2 - Hole 15



Hole 16 (Par 5, 469 yards)

Ok, now these par 5s are getting a little ridiculous. Either that, or I’m just playing from the wrong tee boxes. This one comes in at 456 yards, and I believe is the first and only time that water comes into play on the course.

In two shots I’m just off the green, and after a tumultuous couple holes before it, I make my par and walk away.

This actually played as a par 4 during the US Open, and at 489 yards, is just 3 yards shorter than the blue tees which play it as a par 5.

Pinehurst 2 - Hole 16

Hole 17 (Par 3, 155 yards)

At this point it was near dark, and we were hurrying to get the round in. I don’t know if it was the light or Donald Ross playing tricks on us, but no one could seem to dial it in to get the right distance on this hole.



Pretty much anywhere not on the green is in trouble.

Pinehurst 2 - Hole 17

Hole 18 (Par 4, 382 yards)

What’s there to say about #18? Well, I’m not totally sure, as I could barely see it when I played 🙂

I will say walking down the 18th fairway to where Payne Stewart made that championship-winning putt in 1999 was a pretty remarkable feeling. You can clearly imagine all of the grandstands, and cheering, and I imagine no matter how many times you play it – it would never get old.

I ended up having a 12 foot putt to save par, and tie the best round of my life with an 81.

In near darkness, I stepped up to the ball, visualized my line, and rolled it in, completing what is easily one of the most memorable rounds of my life.



Pinehurst 2 - Hole 18

Final Thoughts on Pinehurst #2

Despite not being in love with the par 3s, I actually liked the course more than I was expecting to.

I can hear you now “It’s ranked so high, and has so much history! How could you expect not to like it?”

I’ve come to find, that it’s rarely the classic, championship, true-test-of-golf courses that are my favorites.

Why?

Well for one, because they’re hard!

But on top of that, I like holes that are memorable, quirky, unique, and most importantly fun.


Many courses similar to Pinehurst (Oakland Hills, Olympic Club, etc.) are incredible to play because of the history and prestige but don’t have quite the same wow factor as some other courses.

With all of that said, I thoroughly enjoyed Pinehurst #2. It lived up to expectations, and the greens were honestly unlike anything I’ve ever seen before. Luckily my speed was pretty much on for the day, as I only had one birdie, but numerous tap in pars.

Simply put, this is a pilgrimage every golfer has to make at some point in their lives. Is it a cheap round? Absolutely not. Is it one you and your buddies will talk about for the rest of your lives? You bet.

And luckily, even though this round may very well be the most expensive one of your life, Pinehurst Resort has 8 other incredible courses that are each unique, more affordable, and potentially, even more enjoyable as a recreational golfer."

From being the cradle of American golf to Payne Stewart’s famous U.S. Open win to being the first course to host the men’s and women’s U.S. Open back to back, the No.2 course at Pinehurst is a bucket list course for any golf aficionado. No.2 features some of the strongest shot values on the planet and there is no part of your game that it doesn’t test. From punishing length to deadly accuracy to exacting finesse, you have to have your ‘A’ game going all day to conquer the mighty No.2. Its famous domed greens look big, but the effective landing areas are small with the slightest miscalculation being punished to the fullest extent of the law. If there is some forgiveness to be had it is off the tee as the fairways are more generous now than before the Coore & Crenshaw renovation. Instead of the thick rough found in the previous century, fairways were expanded and waste areas were exposed outside of the short grass. When the course is running firm though, the lack of rough can result in precarious lies where luck is the biggest factor after a ball chases through the fairway. There isn’t a lot of movement in the terrain at No.2 except for a brief stretch on each nine, which is nice for walking but not quite as engaging while playing. Speaking of walking, there are no carts on No.2 with players being required to walk with, or without, a caddie. Ultimately Pinehurst rides its history to its lofty rankings on the major magazines lists, but is still worth dropping the coin on for one loop around while making sure to take some of the resort’s other courses in as well.

Individual Hole Analysis
Signature Hole:  18th Hole – 451 Yard Par 4 – Standing on the final tee at Pinehurst there is a lot going on. There is the emotion of playing the last hole of the day, the challenge of a 451 yard uphill two-shotter, the history of those that have come before you, and tons of trouble to find as a massive waste bunker crosses in front of the tee and works its way up the right side. Bunkers provide a wall of defense in front of the elevated green and demand a high, soft approach shot. The 18th hole is a perfect example of what Pinehurst is all about. Demanding, yet fair, tee shots followed up by a more demanding approach shot. #2 is simply a shot makers course, which by #18 you will be well aware of!

18th Hole at Pinehurst Resort No.2 (451 Yard Par 4)
Best Par 3:  9th Hole – 191 Yards – When you come to Pinehurst you should have one expectation above anything else; challenging greens. The course that is perhaps the most demanding approach shot course in the world boasts green complexes that will test every aspect of your short game and the 9th is a good example of it. The right third of the green slopes off the edges while the rest of the green is mostly surrounded by bunkering. Anything that doesn't find the putting surface will require exacting work to save par. The long, thin bunker short of the right side is a lousy spot to be if the pin is on the left third of the green as it leaves an awkward distance to hit precisely from the sand. This hole is one of the most striking visual holes since the restoration.

9th Hole at Pinehurst Resort No.2 (191 Yard Par 3)
Best Par 4:  8th Hole – 502 Yards – A very strong two-shotter, the 8th plays as a par four from the tips and a par five from the closer tees. The tee shot plays from a natural rise in the terrain down to a sunken fairway before climbing back up to the raised greensite. Tee shots up the left side that bring the trees into play but can be rewarded with a speed slot that will generate some extra distance. The classic Ross domed green here makes it difficult to get close to the flag, especially if you are trying to get close to a rear pin placement when balls can trickle off the back and leave a brutal up and down scenario. While the front of the green is open for approaches on the ground or in the air, it is one of the most challenging greens to hit in regulation and a cracker of a hole.

8th Hole at Pinehurst Resort No.2 (502 Yard Par 4)
Best Par 5:  5th Hole – 576 Yards – For years the 5th hole at Pinehurst #2 was one of the most celebrated par fours in North Carolina, and with good reason. However, the hole played as a par five in the original design and up until the 1951 Ryder Cup when it was converted to a brutal two-shotter. It was lengthened and reintroduced as a par five leading into the 2014 U.S. Opens while the 4th hole, formerly a par five, was reduced to a par four. This big par five doglegs to the left around a waste area while trees line the right side. The fairway slopes from right to left and it will take about 300 yards to clear the bunker on the left side if you try to shorten the hole. The green complex is one of the most brilliant designs anywhere and requires absolute precision when playing it. The edges around the green are quick to repel shots that don't approach with sufficient energy and bunkers lie in wait to create more grief. From the lower bunker on the left there is hope of getting up and down with a spinning sand shot that makes it high enough onto the putting surface to hold, but from the high bunker on the right it will take Tour level skill to get up and down. There are no pin placements within seven paces of the perimeter of the green due to the severity of the slope and it will take all of your game and strategy to come out on top here.

5th Hole at Pinehurst Resort No.2 (576 Yard Par 5)
Birdie Time:  3rd Hole – 387 Yard Par 4 – There are plenty of punishing holes at Pinehurst, so taking advantage of this early gift is paramount. The hole plays across flat ground to a generous fairway where only 250 yards is needed to stay short of the fairway bunker on the right and set up a wedge into the green. Aggressive players may try to clear the fairway bunkers and drive it up to a chipping area left of the green. The green isn't as severe as others on the course so players can attack pins with more confidence. During the 2014 U.S. Open this hole yielded more birdies than any other, except for the par five 4th (which used to be a par four).

3rd Hole at Pinehurst Resort No.2 (387 Yard Par 4)
Bogey Beware:  4th Hole – 529 Yard Par 4 – Donald Ross said that championship golf courses, like Pinehurst #2, should “call for long and accurate tee shots, accurate iron play, precise handling of the short game, and finally, consistent putting.” To walk away with a par at the lengthy second hole, at least three of those elements better be spot on. Played as a par five prior to the 2014 U.S. Open, the 4th now stands as Pinehurst's most difficult par four. Tipping out well over 500 yards, the 4th plays from an elevated tee to a fairway that steadily turns to the left the entire way to the hole. Waste bunkers are found randomly along the outside of the fairway in conjunction with the 1940s version of the hole and more bunkers are featured left and right of the green. The putting surface tilts hard right to left and acts as the hole’s biggest defense; as if the length wasn't tough enough already. The swell in front of the green is a well used collection area for approaches that don't come in with sufficient juice to climb onto the putting surface. As a par five, it was a hole players looked at as a possible scoring opportunity; as a par four it is a bogey magnet."

A small membership that is the epitome of ""historic old school"" is what you'll find here with members who know the game, respect the game, and honor its history. There isn't a country club feel at CGC, it is akin to San Francisco Golf Club where it is all about golf. Players walk, take a caddie, and soak in some of the best template holes that C.B. Macdonald ever created, including a set of par threes that only Camargo can rival as the best the Good Doctor ever carved out of the ground. Speaking of the ground, the terrain at CGC is mostly flat with subtle changes throughout the property along the same lines as Kingston Heath and Garden City Golf Club. Despite the flatness, there is no lapse of interest given the brilliance of the architecture, bunker placements, and shaping throughout the putting surfaces. The course length is modest by today's standards tipping out under 6900 yards, but no one at the club is concerned with that; in fact, many members choose to play the middle tees to most closely replicate the experience Macdonald had when he designed the course. The historic club is no stranger to hosting high profile events having welcomed the world's best players for the U.S. Open in 1897, 1900, and 1911 while more recently hosting the Women's Senior U.S. Open in 2018. Chicago Golf Club has also hosted the Walker Cup in 1928 and again in 2005 but has hosted more amateur tournaments than anything else with the U.S. Amateur in 1897, 1905, 1909, and 1912 as well as the Women's U.S. Amateur in 1903 and U.S. Senior Amateur in 1979. Ultimately, an invitation to Chicago Golf Club is an opportunity to be cherished and an experience never to be forgotten.

Individual Hole Analysis
Signature Hole:  3rd Hole – 219 Yard Par 3 – The one-shotters at Chicago Golf Club are of the highest caliber and none are finer than the first; the famous Biarritz. Pin positions are only found in the back third which is perfect considering how well the superintendent maintains nearly ideal firm and fast conditions. After carrying the bunker fronting the target, the tight grass leading up to the putting surface is deft at skipping balls through the chasm and on top of the green where the flag awaits. The green complex is encircled by bunkers and creates a virtual island green, however the sand is shaped thinly enough that big misses will finish in the rough or perhaps in the tree line on the left that creates the club's eastern boundary near the southern end of the property. During a golf tournament, you'd have a hard time dragging me away from watching shot after shot comes into this masterful hole.

3rd Hole at Chicago Golf Club (219 Yard Par 3)
Best Par 3:  7th Hole – 207 Yards – The template hole I see copied more than any other, but rarely nearly as well as what is found at CGC, is Redan. This fantastic rendition boasts a very large putting surface and an obvious slope that is anxious to work your ball toward the flag that will always be found on the left half of the putting surface. With the firm conditions, a very viable play is to hit a low running shot that carries the bunker in front before ascending up the face of the green before swinging left in classic Redan fashion. As is always the case with a good Redan, the bunker fronting the green and angling left with the putting surface is a death trap with a steep face that you want to avoid at all costs. After playing this wonderful and pure rendition of a Redan, you will likely find yourself shaking your head trying to figure out what Tom Doak and Jim Urbina were thinking when they designed their version of Redan as the 12th hole at Old Macdonald; perhaps the worst hole at the entire Bandon Dunes Resort.

7th Hole at Chicago Golf Club (207 Yard Par 3)
Best Par 4:  12th Hole – 462 Yards – I've never played a Punchbowl hole I didn't like, and the 12th at Chicago Golf Club is no exception. Five fairway bunkers are scattered across the short grass enroute to the green which is certainly a factor to consider given how important the second shot is here. Approaches coming in from the left side are ideal as they avoid the deep bunker at the front right of the green while also taking advantage of the slope in the putting surface that can be quick to feed balls near the hole given the drainage slope out the back right. Like most Punchbowl holes, the second shot is coming in from a longer distance than most second shots given the generous sloping of the green and puts a premium on accuracy with those clubs in your bag as missing the putting surface is a costly mistake. The best and most fun hole on the back nine, it is great to see some modern courses implementing Punchbowl designs that embrace the elements CGC shows here.

12th Hole at Chicago Golf Club (462 Yard Par 4)
Best Par 5:  4th Hole – 536 Yards – One of only two par fives at the course, Long is considered one of two Cape holes at CGC (14th is the other) though the turn left is fairly slight, but does feature a large boomerang bunker and waste area on the inside of the turn that you'll want to avoid. While the green can be reached in two, it takes a very precise shot in order to clear the false front but not come in so hot that your ball feeds off the back into the horseshoe bunker hugging the putting surface. The elevated green represents one of the largest rises on the property and a moment where a decision has to be made in calculating the firmness of the ground with the slope that wants to repel shots that come up wanting. Even laying up doesn't guarantee a chance to go flag hunting unless it is positioned in the center of the green, because that is the only safe place to aim on this challenging putting surface. Ultimately, this is a high quality par five and an example of what can be done with relatively tame property to work with.

4th Hole at Chicago Golf Club (536 Yard Par 5)
Birdie Time:  5th Hole – 358 Yard Par 4 – Midway through each nine Macdonald offers a short par four to try and take advantage of. On the back nine it is the 351 yard Cape hole with a narrow entrance into the green, and on the front it is the 358 Leven hole. As is typical with Leven holes, a heroic carry is required off the tee for the optimal angle into the green, but here at Chicago Golf Club that carry isn't as challenging as it was originally as the angled cross bunker on the right side requires just 240 yards to clear from the back tee and less than 200 yards from the middle tee. The right half of the green is unobstructed for a shot to run up onto the putting surface while the left side has a bunker that must be flown. Interestingly, the spine in the middle of the green can dictate which side of the fairway you want to attack from and which half of the putting surface to finish on. With the prevailing Chicago winds likely at your back, this is a great opportunity to take a rip at the green and show off your short game to complete the birdie.

5th Hole at Chicago Golf Club (358 Yard Par 4)
Bogey Beware:  2nd Hole – 481 Yard Par 4 – The Road hole is often the most difficult par on a template course and Chicago Golf Club is no different. Within 20 yards of being a 500 yard par four, the 2nd hole will require length and accuracy in order to put up a fair fight. Four fairway bunkers line the left side and creep further toward the center line the farther down the fairway you get. Those bunkers influence golfers to attack the right side of hole, which is the optimal angle into the green, but total precision is needed to make it work as it is easier to end up in the right rough than it is the short grass when carrying the lone bunker on that side. The false front on the right side is ready to deny shots that approach the green with insufficient energy and on the left of course awaits the infamous Road bunker where par saves are few and far between. CGC is known for its difficult starting stretch, and this hole is a key reason why."
26,Chicago GC,top100,"Wheaton, IL","C.B. Macdonald, 1895/Seth Raynor, 1923",1895,Chicago Golf Club,top100golfcourses,rev026_chicago_gc_2,"It’s possible that Chicago acquired its “Windy City” nickname thanks to the cooling summer lake breezes, which funnel their way through the city streets, and it’s also feasible that the great World’s Columbian Exhibition of 1893 was the catalyst for the formation of Chicago Golf Club. After all, the city needed a golf course for the visiting VIPs.

Founded in 1892, Chicago Golf Club was initially located at Belmont. In 1894 it moved to its present location at Wheaton and it became the first 18-hole course in America, designed by the daddy of American golf course architecture, Charles Blair Macdonald.

Chicago Golf Club has a number of firsts to write home about. In 1897 it was the first club outside the Northeast to host the US Open and it was also the first club to employ bent grass greens. Chicago was also one of the five founder members of the American Golf Association, which was subsequently renamed the USGA. The other four charter members were: Newport Country Club, Shinnecock Hills Golf Club, St. Andrew's Golf Club (Yonkers, N.Y.), and The Country Club.

George Bahto commented as follows in The Evangelist of Golf : “Macdonald’s original design was not dramatically altered for over 20 years with the exception of a few suggestions by famed British architect Harry Colt. With new and better courses popping up all the time, the architect of Sunningdale, at the club’s request, tweaked the design to help keep the quality of the course competitive with some of the more modern layouts. Ultimately though, Chicago Golf Club’s design became antiquated and the club voted in 1922 to retain Macdonald’s legendary protégé, Seth Raynor, to assist Macdonald in completely remodeling the layout.”

The club staged many early championships, including the US Amateur, US Open and the Walker Cup. In 1928, Bobby Jones was the Walker Cup playing captain and he posted an amazing course record 66, which drove team USA to an emphatic 11-1 victory. The Walker Cup returned to Chicago for the second time in 2005.

Chicago Golf Club is one of America’s most exclusive golf clubs and today it is still intensely private, but if you’ve been lucky enough to play this famous course, we’d love to read your review."
27,Riviera,top100,"Pacific Palisades, CA",George Thomas Jr./Billy Bell Sr.,1927,A George Thomas Classic: Riviera,Andy Johnson,rev027_riviera_1,"Riviera Country Club, one of America’s iconic golf courses, is tucked away in a residential area off the busy Sunset Boulevard. The course sits in a small canyon, a relatively unpromising site where, in 1927, George C. Thomas, Jr., laid out his masterpiece. Thomas was a member of the Philadelphia School of Architecture, and after building Whitemarsh Valley Country Club in his hometown, he decided to take his talents to California, where he ended up designing courses for Los Angeles’s three preeminent country clubs: Riviera, Los Angeles, and Bel-Air.

Since its inception, Riviera has been a fixture in tournament golf, serving as the annual venue for the Los Angeles Open (now known as the Genesis Invitational), the closing event of the PGA Tour’s West Coast swing. It has also hosted a handful of national championships, including the 1948 U.S. Open, the 1983 and 1995 PGA Championships, the 1998 U.S. Senior Open Championship, and the 2017 U.S. Amateur. In 2028, Riviera will host the Summer Olympics. The course at Riviera shows an architect at the height of his skill. The land is hardly awe-inspiring; George Thomas and his construction man William P. Bell were given a small, mostly flat property, and they didn’t move much dirt. Yet Thomas and Bell found all sorts of great natural hole concepts. At the Redan par-3 4th, for instance, they simply used the side of the canyon to create the slope necessary for their rendition of the template design.
Early photos of Riviera indicate that Thomas and Bell created a naturalized and rugged aesthetic that has been lost today, but the design is strong enough to shine with almost any presentation.

This overlay, created by Scott Griffith (@bottomgroove), demonstrates how Riviera has evolved over the years. Bill Coore and Ben Crenshaw worked on the bunkers in the early 90s and, most recently, Tom Fazio gave the bunkers and the barranca on 8th hole a facelift. These kinds of changes are likely to keep coming, as Riviera is one of the most visible and frequently discussed venues on the PGA Tour.
The course

Riviera has to be in the conversation as one of the best-designed golf courses in America. It tests all aspects of a player’s game and has no weak holes. The course is also incredibly treacherous. Television cameras can’t do justice to the depth of the bunkering. A mishit shot that finds a green-side bunker results in a genuine penalty, especially on the short side. Many thanks to Jon Cavalier (@linksgems) for contributing his photos to this profile.
Hole No. 1 – 503 yards – par 5  Set some 60 feet above the fairway, the 1st tee is where you “enter the canyon,” but not before your name is announced by the starter. This is one of Riviera’s distinctive traditions. Teeing off at a great course is already special, but the starter experience adds some butterflies to the experience. The 1st hole is more of a par 4.5 than a par 5, as a strong tee shot will leave a mere mid-iron into a boomerang green that wraps around a deep bunker. Long hitters may have to use a 3-wood to stay short of the crossing barranca, which gives the hole a Sahara or Great Hazard feel. The heavily sloped green presents the main challenge, setting the tone for the rest of the round.
Hole No. 2 – 471 yards – par 4  While the 1st offers a great birdie chance, the 2nd is as stout a par 4 as you will find in golf. The hole plays into the prevailing wind and slightly uphill, making its 471 yards feel more like 500. Your tee shot has to find the fairway if you want any chance finding the long, narrow green in two, as the kikuyu rough is a menace for long-iron shots. A bunker 40 yards short of the green threatens both lay-up and run-up attempts, but a well-placed approach can feed onto the two-tiered putting surface from a slope on the right side.
Hole No. 3 – 434 yards – par 4 The 3rd hole at Riviera is a mid-length par 4 that bends slightly to the right. A left-to-right tee shot will have the best chance of finding the narrow fairway, which is protected by trees on the left. The hole’s strategy is best understood from the green back. The right side of the putting surface is guarded by a deep bunker, and the left side slopes severely to the left. These characteristics of the green make playing from the left side of the fairway preferable, even necessary.
Hole No. 4 – 236 yards – par 3  Ben Hogan called the 4th at Riviera “the greatest par-3  hole in America.” High praise, for sure, but the hole lives up to it.

George Thomas employed the Redan template here and, as I mentioned above, did so in a natural way, using the slope of the canyon to create the shoulder that kicks well-placed shots toward the hole. The bunker that blocks the logical entrance to this long par 3 will force most players to go right and use that natural slope.
Hole No. 5 – 434 yards – par 4 Although overshadowed by more famous holes like Nos. 4, 6, 10, and 18, the 5th should be in the discussion as one of the finest par 4s in the world. The tee shot favors precision over power. There is plenty of room on the right side of the fairway, but an approach from there will be obstructed by a large mound. The ideal line, therefore, is up the left, but that play comes with its own risks, as the trees down that side can block you out if you’re a little too far left. The green has a spine running through it and a steep swale that gobbles up any approaches slightly right of target.
Hole No. 6 – 199 yards – par 3 One of the most photographed holes in golf, the par-3 6th features a small bunker in the middle of the green. This iconic bunker is one of three around this green: there’s also a large, deep front bunker and a nasty back bunker, which come into play for different pin positions. The putting surface has a great deal of back-to-front slope, making any putt from pin-high or above a challenge.
Here’s a view of the 6th hole you might not see very often: from a house behind and above the hole. It shows particularly well how strangely shaped the green is. Imitated, but never equaled.

Hole No. 7 – 408 yards – par 4 George Thomas was particularly adept at creating unique strategic challenges on his shorter par 4s. The 7th at Riviera is a good example. A massive bunker on the left and a barranca down the right require a precise tee shot. But what’s so clever about the design is that the more aggressive a you get with your drive, the more the fairway bunker cuts in. The prudent play may be to lay back with an iron, but the hole is short enough to be tempting. It begs you to try and thread the needle. Those who lay back will face a mid-iron approach to a small target. The 7th green is narrow and has bunkers on the right and a runoff area on the left. The putting surface itself is no picnic, either, with its severe back-to-front slope.
Hole No. 8 – 460 yards – par 4  In 2008, Tom Fazio’s firm completed what Riviera billed as a restoration of Thomas’s original split fairway on the 8th hole. Fazio’s work has perhaps brought back Thomas’s strategic intentions from tee to green, but in my opinion, Fazio butchered the green, which now stick out like a sore thumb. In general, the concept for the hole works better on paper than in practice. There just isn’t much of a reason to go left. From there, you’ll have a slightly better angle into the green, but the risk outweighs the potential reward. This is the one hole at Riviera that could use another round of tweaks.
Hole No. 9 – 458 yards – par 4 The front nine comes to a close with the spectacularly beautiful 9th, which gives players a full view of Riviera’s majestic clubhouse. The longish par 4 plays uphill, and the shallow green tends to reject any approaches not from the fairway. Players need to thread their tee shot between fairway bunkers on both the right and the left, and a good ball sets up a mid- to short iron to the elevated green. The toughest pin location is back left, behind a devilish green-side bunker.
Hole No. 10 – 315 yards – par 4 Riviera’s back nine opens with one of the most revered short par 4s in golf, where a 2 and an 8 are equally in play. On the tee, George Thomas tempts you to pull driver and aim for the pin. This shot is risky but, if well placed, can lead to an eagle look. The safe play is an iron to the far left side of the fairway, which sets up a straightaway wedge. Anything on the right side of the fairway is death; from that angle, the green is shallow and runs sharply away. When the turf is firm and fast, it’s nearly impossible to hold the green from anywhere right of the fairway’s center line. Similarly, if you find yourself in the right green-side bunkers, you’ll have trouble keeping your next shot on the putting surface. I have first-hand experience of this. I hit one of the greatest bunker shots of my life from there, and sure enough, when I got up to the green, I saw that my ball was five yards off the edge. The 10th hole is an enduring lesson that strategy and options, not length, are what make a hole both fun and challenging for the most- and least-skilled golfers alike.
Hole No. 11 – 583 yards – par 5 Following the unforgettable 10th is Riviera’s first par 5 since its opener. Here again Thomas employs a Sahara / Great Hazard-style barranca to keep the longest hitters in check. A tee shot that runs up to the edge of the hazard leaves about 270 yards to the green. Deep bunkering around the green once again emphasizes angles. While it’s tempting to attack the green after a good drive, any miss to the right will leave a dicey chip. The ideal landing zone for the second shot is short left, which opens up the green and makes for a relatively easy up-and-down birdie.
Hole No. 12 – 479 yards – par 4  After consecutive birdie opportunities, Riviera flexes its muscle with the demanding par-4 12th. The barranca cuts down the left side, and large eucalyptus trees stand along the right, making hitting the fairway essential to success. The ideal line is down the left center, which offers a good angle to attack a green guarded by a deep front bunker and the barranca gorge.
Hole No. 13 – 459 yards – par 4 In response to flooding issues, the club modified the par-4 13th by planting massive eucalyptus trees along the left side of the fairway to soak up water. These trees have taken away some of the original design’s luster, but 13 remains a great hole. The tee shot requires a right-to-left ball flight, especially from those who reach for driver. On approach, you will have to think about the barranca left and long and the deep bunker to the right.
Hole No. 14 – 192 yards – par 3  The thrilling back-nine run takes a breather with the relatively benign par-3 14th, which features an extremely wide and shallow green. The key here is distance control, as any miss long or short-sided will make for a tough up-and-down on a green running hard from right to left and back to front.
Hole No. 15 – 492 yards – par 4  It doesn’t get much attention, but the 15th is one of the most striking holes at Riviera. This long, demanding par 4 calls for a left-to-right tee shot that avoids the deep fairway bunker on the right. A good drive leaves a long to mid-iron into a Biarritz-like green. Each shot needs to be well struck and well placed.
Hole No. 16 – 166 yards – par 3 With pressure mounting down the stretch, players confront a test of nerves at the beautiful, exacting par-3 16th. You need full trust in your yardage, as any miss meets immediate punishment either in the brutal bunkers or with a challenging putt across the diabolical green, which slopes severely from back to front and left to right.
Hole No. 17 – 590 yards – par 5 After the 16th, the 17th, a long par 5, starts the trek back to the clubhouse. Bunkers wait for misses off the tee both left and right, and the hole climbs uphill, making it tough to reach in two for all except the PGA Tour’s longest hitters. The most memorable feature of the 17th is the varied array of bunkers, which influence decision-making on lay-ups as well as approach shots into the small, well-protected green.
Hole No. 18 – 475 yards – par 4 The round comes to its close at the iconic 18th, which starts with a semi-blind tee shot to a fairway the climbs the side of the canyon. Mature trees loom on the right and force play to the left side of the fairway, lengthening the hole and leading to sidehill lies on the approach. The second shot is a real challenge. A miss left results in a fast pitch from a downhill lie, and a miss right can bound into terrible places. The green sits in a natural amphitheater: a grand setting and a fitting finish to a true championship course.
Riviera does not have memorable views or a memorable property. The reason it’s an unforgettable course is that George Thomas and William Bell made it so. The subtle, strategic design and the outstanding variety of holes test every club in the bag and every facet of the game. Where Riviera especially excels is in taking the full measure of a player’s decision-making skills and nerves—even if that player is one of the best in the world. Year in and year out, Riviera is arguably the best, most entertaining stop on the PGA Tour. While I can’t help wondering how great a faithful restoration of Thomas and Bell’s rugged aesthetics would be, Riviera is still—and will likely always be—one of America’s best championship courses."
28,Riviera,top100,"Pacific Palisades, CA",George Thomas Jr./Billy Bell Sr.,1927,RIVIERA COUNTRY CLUB - 18 POINTS,David Jones,rev028_riviera_2,"Riviera Country Club (or ‘Riv’ as those in the know would have it) is one of American’s most famous golf courses. It’s one of the few places with an enduring event on the PGA Tour. The LA Open was first held here in 1929 and over 75 iterations of the event have been held there since. On top of that, the US Open and the USPGA have both visited and 2028 will bring the Olympics, ensuring Riviera stays firmly in the golf spotlight.

When George Thomas finished the course he declared it his greatest achievement (although it should be noted that this was a common refrain from him!). Once again (cf. Bel Air) imagination was the key to his success. In his definitive account of George Thomas, ‘The Captain’, Geoff Shackelford says, ‘There is little question that Riviera is one of the greatest golf course constructions of all time’. 

This is because the site itself is basically a flat, featureless, canyon valley. There’s not a huge amount of elevation change at Riviera other than the first tee shot and climb up to the 18th.There is a wash running through the middle and that’s about it for natural features. Everything else we see on the course was shaped by Thomas and his team. These days that wouldn’t be such an amazing feat. Modern courses are scooped out of flat sites regularly, as technology has developed. However, in 1927 this was quite an achievement, and the reason the record high $250,000 cost was about three times of that of a normal build of the time.

Most readers will be very familiar with Riviera from the annual TV coverage and it has some of the most iconic holes in the world of professional golf. Here are some of the highlights from my visit to Riviera, as well as some tips for how to get a round. Unlike at most of America’s private courses, the route to playing here is relatively easy (if expensive).

Enjoy the First Tee Experience
Riviera is one of the few courses where everyone gets an announcement on the first tee. When I was there it was a slightly overcast day, and there had been a bit of drizzle in the morning. As a result the place was empty - the only other person around was member, and fellow West Ham supporter, Francesco Molinari working on his putting nearby. What would have counted as a fairly nice day in the east of Scotland had scared all the members away. That didn’t stop the starter clearing his throat and announcing, ‘On the tee, from Scotland, David Jones’. 

I really enjoyed the first hole. You are hitting from a terrace just in front of the clubhouse, down a big drop, onto a huge field below. The fairway isn’t massive side to side but the rough isn’t too punishing. It’s about 280 yards to the dry wash (know as a barranca in these parts) which splits the fairway but I wasn’t expecting to hit a good one, so I hit a driver into the fairway and off we went.

The first at Riviera - probably the easiest hole on the course!

A straightforward par 5 to start is a Thomas trademark and this may be his finest example. Avoiding a topper was the only real thought in my head as we hit off. After that this hole allows you to breathe and enjoy the experience - a lovely start to what would be a memorable round.

A driver from the tee won’t hurt, but it’s all about the angles
I suspect the vast majority of amateur golfers are like me; show us a tee shot with thick trees, water or waist-high rough to the sides of a narrow fairway and we tense up - the swing gets fast and the result is frequently depressing. Well there are no such worries here. From the tee you won’t see huge danger in play. You will almost always be able to hit the ball from wherever it ends up. 

Generally on the course, the rough is of a reasonable depth, most trees allow a punch out and even in the barranca you are likely to have a shot. However, from any of those spots, you will find it hard to get it onto the green with your approach. 

This means that everyone can make progress to the green without too much delay, but only those playing well will have many birdie putts and score well. 

Hitting from hazards is far easier at Riviera than in some LA clubs

Enjoy the special moments….
It is often said that there are no weak holes at Riviera. But there are some standout holes. Some are less well-known than others - I wasn’t familiar with the fifth but it’s sneaky good, with a huge mound built on the right of the fairway blocking your view of the green if you come in from this side. So, you should play up the left to get there in two, but you risk tangling with the trees if you go too far to that side.

The 5th is a less well known, but excellent, hole

Next up is the 6th - a hole to savour. From the middle tees it was just a 7 iron in to this green, but there is a lot to deal with. There are bunkers short, left and behind the green, as well as one bang in the middle! The green slopes significantly from back to front so playing long, past the bunker in the middle, will still leave a challenge for your par. 

The 6th hole at Riviera - note the bunker in the middle of the green

I managed to leave the bunker directly between me and the hole. The scorecard lets you know that amateurs must only take a putter on the green, but I just managed to skirt the edge to hole the putt for a nerve-wracking four. You can see the putt here:

The next hole you are likely to know is the 10th. This is maybe the most famous short par 4 in the world of golf. For years there was a usual choice for pros playing this hole - take a driver and try to get close to the green but risk an offline shot leaving real difficulty getting up and down, or lay back for a fuller shot in. The accuracy and distance of modern equipment mean that virtually all now try to get the ball up to the left of the green, and most succeed.

Looking down the 10th hole from the clubhouse


The challenge for the amateur though is closer to the original intent of the hole. My caddie was very clear, hit a three wood down the left and wedge it in. When you get down there you see what the challenge is. The front of the green is heavily cambered and is just a slither. If the pin is at the front and you are coming in from the right there is virtually no shot a man of my limited skills could hit to keep it on the green. However, from where I was, it was a relatively straightforward wedge up.

The 10th may not pose the same challenge it did to the pros twenty years ago but it is still one of the great examples of a strategic golf hole. Oh yes, and I made a par!

The next few holes have a different feel as you play through the eucalyptus trees. I enjoyed this part of the course which had a lovely serenity about it. 

The 16th hole is a special hole. This short par 3 has a small green, surrounded on all sides by steep, deep bunkers. The sliver trees around the hole add to its beauty and it is just a gorgeous golf hole. All the par threes are pretty special but this may be the best of the lot.

The 16th green is a thing of beauty

The 18th is the final iconic moment in your round. It’s also one of the tougher holes. The tee shot has one of the few forced carries on the course and while it isn’t a long one, it is uphill to a blind fairway - not always a recipe for success. My drive ran off to the right and I was forced to layup in two. In reality though, I would be out there a long time before I hit the green in two. The natural amphitheatre surrounding the green is a fitting climax to your round. As you hole out and look back over the course, you know you’ve just played something pretty special.

If you get a good caddie - enjoy!
I have a checkered past with caddies. It’s not something that I was used to until relatively recently and I’ve only experienced them when playing US private courses. Quite frankly, some of them are useless, just giving me an instruction (‘give me your 160 shot’) followed by a deep sigh when I inevitably screw up. They only take away from my enjoyment of a golf course and usually I would much rather just play on my own. But sometimes it goes well.

My caddie at Riviera was very focussed on me enjoying my round. Before we reached the first green he was already telling me all the celebrities he had caddied for, many in just the last couple of weeks, and the list was impressive. Larry David, President Obama, Justin Timberlake, Tom Brady, Mark Wahlberg - he’d carried for them all. Somehow he managed to impart this information without coming across as an incredible name-dropper (I know, hard to believe!) and it added to my experience of playing Riviera. 

He also had a good knowledge of the club’s history, talked about how the course had changed over the years and tolerated my standard of play with good humour. He didn’t try and play every shot for me, but gave me some advice about the unusual Kikuyu grass and actually explained why he was recommending certain lines or clubs. He added positively to the experience which was a lovely surprise!

Imagine the what if…
There is so much to enjoy at Riviera. It absolutely feels like a golf course well up the top 50 in the world, but there is also a gnawing sense that it could be so much better. I had played Bel Air and LACC on the two days before Riviera. Both have been restored in impressive fashion. LACC is an absolute joy and it feels like you are stepping into a painting from the 1920s. Riviera? Hmm, a bit less so. 

The course has been worked on over the years, but not much has been particularly lauded. A lot of the work in recent years has been done by Fazio and the scars show. Bunkers have lost their original shape, holes have lost their character. The course has been homogenised in too many places when compared to the original Thomas course. When you look at what has been done at LACC you truly wonder what would happen if the club had a management hell-bent on an authentic restoration - it could be magnificent.  

Andy Johnson wrote recently of America’s top candidates for restoration and puts it well when he says, ‘The club could simply restore the original barrancas, bunker styles, and green dimensions without monkeying around with hole lengths or fairway widths. Riviera is currently one of the best golf courses on the West Coast, but it could be one of the best in the country’. The only thing I would add is they could take out the cart paths too…

It would be churlish to end on that note though. Riviera may have flaws in its presentation, but there are none in its design. You don’t have to be an architecture buff to appreciate this course, just teeing it up will be enough. You will find a course which challenges all the way around and you will need every shot in the bag to score well. But it also allows you to breathe, there’s nothing oppressive about Riviera. This is a golf course which will thrill you and give you memories to cherish for life. I’ll tell you one thing, you’ll never forget what you scored at the tenth!

BOOKING THE COURSE

This is yet another one of those American private courses which are hard to play. But the good news is that it isn’t impossible to get a game at Riviera. But be warned - it’s going to cost you.

If you contact the club and explain that you would like to play (I would suggest being suitably reverential in your approach) they may well extend you an offer to play at a quiet time for $575 (late mornings Tuesday-Thursday are best). You obviously need to take a caddie too ($130). Oh yes, and you will need to have an assistant pro accompany you ($200 per group). If you are on your own then that’s a mere $905 for the tee time - it squeezes in under $800 each if you are a 3. Now clearly, on one level this is a ridiculous amount of money to pay for a round of golf. But it you really, really want to do it, and you can afford it, you can play here. That’s more than can be said for LACC or Shinnecock, NGLA or Chicago. 

Of course there are other ways too. Keep an eye out for the charity auctions that come up from time to time (although don’t expect to pay less than the prices above) and a fair few clubs have reciprocals with Riviera. These days Riviera is more and more a club for companies and celebrities, so if you happen to know any of those the route in will be much cheaper.

Prices correct as of August 2023.

29,Friar's Head,top100,"Baiting Hollow, NY",Bill Coore/Ben Crenshaw,2003,FRIAR'S HEAD - 19 POINTS,David Jones,rev029_friar_1,"Friar's Head is a relatively new course on Long Island, not far from the bastions of American golf that are Shinnecock Hills and National Golf Links of America. It is the second highest ranked course built in the last 50 years on the GOLF magazine rating, behind only Sand Hills. It was the first Coore and Crenshaw course that I played and has given me a yearning to play more of their designs. 

This course is simply wonderful, this is one of the very best experiences you will ever have on a golf course and surely it will only continue to rise in the rankings. I have been lucky enough to play at Friar's Head twice now and I enjoyed it even more the second time. 

It's not the easiest place to find - the entrance just marked with a black mail box - and it's closed from early November through to the spring. Even when it is open only gets an average of 10 tee times a day. That's pretty quiet. The first time we played it the condition was perfect, the second time after a tough summer a couple of greens were suffering. It is testament to how great the course is that that didn't diminish our enjoyment at all.

Some of the reviews I had read beforehand made me think that the atmosphere may be a little oppressive. I read about strict rules about no photos (apparently relaxed as no-one mentioned it to us) and the importance of hitting your practice shots in such a way as to minimise the divots on the range. This was mentioned in the nicest possible way and it made perfect sense.

The range facility itself was phenomenal - playing brand new prov1s to proper greens before moving to a short game area and a putting green is to die for. The speed of the practice green was spot on with the rest of the course and served as a great way to get your eye in.

Before venturing out onto the course you can play a delightful little nine-holer. No hole was longer than 160 yards but it's a nice way to warm up before taking on the main event. It demanded creativity and certainly sharpened the wedge play nicely.
Friar's Head Coore Crenshaw Golf Course Review
So, to the course itself. There are some articles out there about Friar's Head which do it far better justice than I ever can. This one from Ran Morrissett over at Golf Club Atlas is probably the best and will give you a hole by hole account of the course. There was some discussion on that site as to Friar's Head should be a Doak 9 or 10 when the latest Confidential Guide came out. In the end he gave it a 9, personally I think he was being a bit stingy! 

The course starts with a very playable par 4. I hit driver, but less would do to a wide fairway (actually, I found the sand on the right) and then it's a wedge on 9 iron up to the elevated green (it reminded me of the 1st at the Kings at Gleneagles for those familiar with the opener there).
Friar's Head Scorecard

It is a tremendously hard course to characterise. Holes are carved out of the dunes and the trees and the course transitions seemingly effortlessly between the two. Much is made if you look online at the fact that there are no yardages on the scorecard or tees and there are no yardages to greens on the course. There is a yardage book now available in the pro shop now, but our caddies were fantastic and gave us everything we needed. They gave yardages on the tee, the course measured an almost perfect 6,460 yards. Anything over 6,500 yards and I find that the par 3s can be a little long and the approaches to the par 4s a little testing. This was just right!

There is not a weak hole on the golf course. The 3rd was playing a little shorter to us due to the wind on both occasions but is a 420 yard sweeping uphill hole, often playing the longest par 4 in the course. In contrast the 5th is a delightful short par 4 of only 300 yards. The first time I played I took a driver and then, thinking I was in North Berwick still, took a putter from 50 yards out just to get the wrong slide of a slope and take another 4 to get down. I was in almost the same spot 12 months later and shanked a wedge this time. Ah, the joys! Number 9 plays back through the dunes from the clubhouse to the most fiendish green.  This is pure quality all the way.  

The 10th is a quirky 200 yard par 3 with a truly huge, mostly blind, green. It not be the longest par 3 you'll every play but if your tee shot goes anywhere apart from the right quadrant of the green you are looking at bogey or worse.
The 14th at Friar's Head

14 is a simply magnificent par 5 with steps behind leading up to spectacular 15th tee. Looking back, I should have taken a rescue club off the tee the first time but the caddie did well to find it for me in the wasteland to the right. I managed a par second time around and had some vengeance. The walk from 15 to 16, along the side of the ocean is pretty special and the closing holes continue in the vein of the rest of the course. Breathtaking, fair, and an experience not to be forgotten.

As you can see, I loved this place. The set-up was understated, friendly but incredibly high quality; the caddies were great and the course a dream. Our caddie was telling us that he had caddied earlier in the week for Coore and Crenshaw who are regular visitors - looking at how they can continue to tweak the course. That attention really pays off.

It's definitely the kind of course you just want to go straight back out and play again. It's the best modern course I have played and I would rate it right up there in my top half dozen yet. If you ever get the chance, drop everything and go

BOOKING THE COURSE

Being an American private course a tee time here is tricky. There used to be an annual charity day here but that has moved. Your best bet now is checking out Charitybuzz which regularly has auctions for three balls where you will then join a member to make up a fourball. It’s not a cheap way of playing the course, but unless you know a member it may be the only way!"
30,Friar's Head,top100,"Baiting Hollow, NY",Bill Coore/Ben Crenshaw,2003,Friar’s Head Golf Club: One of the Best Golf Days of My Life,Sean Ogle,rev030_friar_2,"023 was a good golf year, to put it mildly.

For years, I’d done a pretty good job of playing at a bunch of new courses each year as I grew Breaking Eighty and my golf travel IQ.


Then COVID hit.

I didn’t get on an airplane for 21 months.

During that time I also had my first kid, which as you might guess, doesn’t lend itself well to travel.

Well, in 2023 I made up for lost time.

It started with 4 days at Bandon Dunes in January.

In February, I spent the month in Australia with my family playing courses that I legitimately never thought I’d get to play like Barnbougle Dunes and New South Wales. Not to mention half a dozen more I have yet to write about here on Breaking Eighty.

In May it was Paynes Valley.

June, Oakmont followed by Kohanaiki.

August brought rounds at Hualalai, Merion, Aronimink, Baltusol, Quaker Ridge, and Wykagyl.

But it was my first round in September that was the one I’d been waiting a decade to play:

Friar’s Head.

I’ve listed Bandon Trails among my top 10 favorite courses for years.

Coore and Crenshaw have worked on some really special projects.

But the mystique around Friar’s Head has always intrigued me. 

Insane views on Long Island?

Extremely exclusive, small membership – with an initiation fee most of us couldn’t ever fathom?

And that’s all completely ignoring the fact that it’s routinely listed among the top 25 courses in the World.

It’s the ultimate golf day, and one that, unfortunately, most golfers will never get to play.

Somehow I won the lottery and last Summer got to spend a day at Friar’s Head.

I’ve played a lot of really special golf courses and had some unbelievable golf days.

My day at Friar’s Head was one of the top 3 golf days of my life.

Let me tell you about it.

Getting to Friar’s Head

I’ve traveled a fair amount within the Pacific Northwest with my friend Jeff, but we’d never taken a golf trip.

So after years of talking about it, I finally convinced him to come to New York with me.

We went all out, playing all of the aforementioned courses across Philly and the NYC area.

But the night before Friar’s Head, which was our last round of the trip, was the only night we stayed in Manhattan.

I splurged and got us a room at the Park Hyatt, and told him I was taking him on the cocktail tour of his life. It started at the #2 bar in the world, Double Chicken Please. It ended at the Dead Rabbit, the former #1 bar in the world, and there 7 world-class bars in between.

Our tee time wasn’t until 1, we’d be fine, right?

The hangover was bad, but it was the traffic jam getting out of Manhattan that caused the biggest headache.

1 hour to go 4 blocks.

If we missed this tee time, I’d never forgive myself.

Fortunately, once we got out of the city the Long Island Expressway traffic was fairly light and we pulled onto 3000 Sound Avenue about 30 minutes before our tee time.

Friars Head Mailbox
The iconic 3000 mailbox.
We were escorted to the wonderful range and practice area, where we hit a few quick balls (Pro V1s, of course) before heading back towards the first tee where we met the members who were hosting us.

They were friends of a friend who (very) generously agreed to have us out. It took all of about half a hole to realize just how welcoming they were – and honestly, this is really what made the day so special.

The Front 9 at Friar’s Head

Despite being so excited to play this course, I didn’t know that much about it.


I purposefully refrained from doing much research ahead of time.

I’d also heard stories about how strict they were about taking photos on the course. Not wanting to make an awkward ask of the people hosting us, I left my camera in the car.

Big mistake, considering it was a chamber of commerce day and they said the photo policy has been loosened quite a bit over the years.

So here, you get iPhone photos 🙂

The opening tee shot isn’t overly challenging with a big wide fairway. But then the approach is to a severely elevated, deep green. It doesn’t take long to figure out you should trust your caddie with, well, everything.

Friars Head Hole 1
The elevated green on the first gole
The opening on the Kings Course at Gleneagles is the most similar opening hole I’ve seen. The approach also has vibes of the approach on the first hole at Bandon Dunes.

There are a lot of impressive viewpoints around the course. Simply looking back at the clubhouse from the first green is one of them.

The second tee shot is the next. An elevated tee shot that plays downhill and gives a great view of the front 9.

Friars Head Hole 2
The tee shot on 2.
The two 9s each roughly form circles is a bit of aa figure 8 routing. The back 9 plays counterclockwise on one part of the property, and then when you hit 10 it plays (mostly) clockwise around a separate part of the property – with a finishing stretch near the Long Island Sound.


The 5th is one of the great short par 4s in golf, measuring around 300 yards. There are no yardages on the scorecard, so you end up playing holes from a variety of fun distances.

It’s also welcome after the monster par 3, 4th.

Friars Head 4th hole
Par 3, 4th hole
That said, short doesn’t mean “easy”. As if you don’t strike your drive well you could easily find yourself in a gnarly bunker to the right of the green.

And if you do strike it well, there’s another bunker right in the middle of your ideal line that could also swallow your ball.

It wouldn’t be a Coore Crenshaw course without a short par 4.

Just watch out for this bunker on your drive.
The par 5, 7th is a standout hole. A wonderful uphill par 5 that brings you back into the dunes and is one of the more visually stunning holes on the front.

Friars Head Hole 7
The uphill par 5, 7th. Wish I’d gotten a photo of this green.
The greens on the course are among the best I’ve ever played in terms of variety and interest. The 7th is particularly interesting given how massive it is and with fairly severe contours and mounding.

The downhill 9th is arguably the signature hole (or at least the signature photo spot.)

Friars Head Hole 9
The view from 9 tee.
For years, the only photo I saw of the course was from 9 teebox looking back down at the clubhouse and over the sound.

It’s truly one of the best views in golf.

The Back 9 at Friar’s Head

The back 9 starts out with a long, 200-ish yard par 3. The signature here is the large mound that guards the left side of the green and feels more reminiscent of something built in Scotland 100 years ago.

The par 5s at Friar’s Head are cool in that they feel like they’re transporting you into different environments of the course.

2 takes you down into the meadow, then 7 is back up into the dunes.

11 brings you back down again, and then 14 takes you up into the dunes and is the beginning of a world-class finishing stretch of holes.

Looking back at 11
Seriously, the stretch of 14-18 is among the very best stretch of golf holes I’ve ever played.

14 is a risk-reward par 5 that has a little bit of everything. 

Friars Head Hole 14
14 begins one of the very best stretch of holes I’ve ever played.
You can bail out left to stay safe from a massive bunker, but it makes the hole significantly longer.

The more of the bunker you take on, the shorter the hole gets, but your margin for error increases in step with the aggressiveness of your line.

The green is set in a natural amphitheater and has a bit of a false front to it. 

Notice the stairs going up to the 15th teebox. The only better walk, is the one walking off the 15th.

15 is a downhill par 4 that heads straight out towards the Long Island Sound.

The 15th.
It’s another fantastic view. If you’re a better player than me and don’t pump it into the waste area right (exactly where you don’t want to be), it can be a chance to score as the green isn’t quite as intense as some others on the course.

But the most memorable moment of the round is the one that everyone had told me about, the bridge from 15 to 16.

Friars Head Bridge
Looking back at the bridge between 15 and 16. Sitting here was one of the coolest golf moments I’ve had.
I haven’t played Cypress Point, but I imagine the walks to 15 and 16 elicit similar feelings to what you get walking to 16 at Friar’s Head.

16 is a fantastic par 4, that is deceptively difficult. This is one of those holes you need to play a few times to understand it. The obvious play is to go out to the right. But what you don’t realize is that if you’re short, you’re actually leaving yourself with a much longer shot than if you go over the ridge left.

Friars Head 16 Approach
The approach on 16.

It’s hard not to get on the tee at 17 without thinking “how cool would it be to hit a hole-in-one here?”

It’s the last par 3, the shortest hole on the course. But despite appearing “easy” on paper, anything less than an ideally struck shot can end up in the waste bunker where bogey or worse quickly becomes the most likely outcome.

The final par 3.
Finally, 18 is a challenging par 4 that requires two very well-struck shots in order to give yourself a fighting chance. I had one of my better drives of the day, and then hitting the green in front of the clubhouse and making an easy two-putt par was a great way to finish.

The approach on 18.
The Showers at Friar’s Head

No proper article about Friar’s Head would be complete without mentioning the showers.

The showers here are the only thing more legendary than the course itself.

For years I’ve always heard about Merion being the gold standard of golf showers – and to be clear, they’re very good.

But the showers at Friar’s Head? They blow them away. Literally.

This is the closest thing you’ll experience to getting blasted from a firehouse short of walking out of a burning building.

I’ve never experienced anything like it. If you visit, do whatever you can to experience this as it is truly the best shower in golf.

Final Thoughts on Friar’s Head

Awhile back I wrote about bucket list courses that actually exceed expectations.

Friar’s Head is the perfect example of this.

Yes, we had a spectacular day. Yes, the company was phenomenal. A lot was working in our favor.

But Friar’s Head is one of those courses you could play day in and day out and never get bored. There are so many nuances and interesting elements that you could play dozens of rounds and still find something new each time.

I’d like to think I’ll have the chance to visit Friar’s Head again in the future. But if I don’t? I’m incredibly thankful for the opportunity and for what immediately became one of the best golf days of my life.

The course is amazing. The setting and the experience is even better."
31,Winged Foot (West),top100,"Mamaroneck , NY",A.W. Tillinghast,1923,Approaching the Unpinnable,Andy Johnson,rev031_winged_foot_1,"“I wish we played a course like this every week. We’d learn how to putt.” -Jack Nicklaus at the 1974 U.S. Open People often describe the greens at the West Course at Winged Foot Golf Club as treacherous, or scary, or beautiful. I would call them enduring. Designed by A.W. Tillinghast in 1923, the greens at Winged Foot West are the definition of severe. Getting up and down from around them is very difficult, which puts a premium on precise approach shots. Also, the greens have an abundance of unpinnable surface: the false fronts, back wings, and sideboards make short-sided misses a nightmare and reward creative pitches and chips. These features make Winged Foot a great course in spite of its geographical shortcomings (rocky slate soil and relatively bland topography) and have helped it endure the onslaught of advances in equipment technology. Nearly 100 years into its life, Winged Foot West is still one of the world’s great championship tests.

The U.S. Open last visited Winged Foot in 2006, when Geoff Ogilvy won at 5-over. Since then, the players have picked up yet more technological aids. This will be the first time that the world’s best male players will take on the bold, sloping Tillinghast greens with the help of green-reading books that will show them every intricate contour. Winged Foot’s counter will be its restoration, finished by Hanse Golf Course Design in 2015. Gil Hanse enlarged the West Course’s greens by 23.8%, regaining tucked pins not seen since the 1920s and increasing unpinnable surface, which drives the strategy of the course. Winged Foot West’s strategy is best understood from the greens backwards. It’s all about knowing whether or not you are in position to approach certain pins. Of course, for the most part, Winged Foot is a test of execution. The fairways are narrow and lined with thick rough and deep dunkers. But players who walk the course backwards and figure out where they can and can’t attack certain greens will stand the best chance of avoiding those zero-penalty-stroke double bogeys, which the West Course is famous for inflicting. At this week’s U.S. Open, recovery shots will be more about getting back into a position to make par or bogey rather than pulling off a heroic shot for a chance at birdie.

Gil Hanse’s restoration of the greens adds a new dimension. When we last saw the West Course host the U.S. Open in ’06, the greens were shadows of their original selves. They had shrunk, and many of their pronounced corners and fronts had been covered in rough. While often unpinnable, these contours on the edges of the greens produce the theatrics that make Winged Foot truly compelling. The severe grades, often above 10%, punish not only approaches from bad positions but also marginal shots from good positions. Hanse and his team brought back a considerable amount of pinnable surface as well. In the graphic below, provided by Winged Foot Golf Club, you can see that the expansion of the 15th green boosted the average slope by 14% but also increased the amount of pinnable area by 43%.



What does all of this mean? Simply that there are now more options for pins and more contours to bedevil shots from poor angles. Unlike at many PGA Tour stops, where any pin on a grade of more than 1% is frowned upon, there will be many putts at Winged Foot that turn hard at the hole. There will be short-sided pitches that bound forward after landing on the recaptured unpinnable sections. On the flip side, there will also be shots, played from the right positions, that use the same contours to funnel the ball closer to the pin. Basically, these greens will reward players who keep a clear head and pay attention to the ground. There’s an important takeaway for the golf world here. It’s time to embrace undulating greens rather than calling them “unfair” or “Mickey Mouse,” or making the same tired joke about how “all that’s missing is a windmill.” Winged Foot West’s greens are what made the course interesting and challenging in the 1920s, and what will continue to make it interesting and challenging in the 2020s. Yes, they’re playing a lot faster now—probably faster than they should—but their essence has endured. At many modern courses, on the other hand, the greens already seem dated, partly because they don’t have the courage to be wild."
32,Winged Foot (West),top100,"Mamaroneck , NY",A.W. Tillinghast,1923,WINGED FOOT (WEST) - 18 POINTS,David Jones,rev032_winged_foot_2,"I went to Winged Foot by accident. We were due to play a highly ranked course of good repute in Long Island (OK, it was Shinnecock), but they had decided to dump several tons of sand on every green and it was unplayable. So, on that late October morning we found ourselves making a dash to Winged Foot, 30 minutes north of Manhattan and a dream of a course.

Frankly, I was a little worried. The trip was for my Dad’s 70th birthday and I thought it would be too tough for both of us. When I was a kid in the 80s, I remember my Dad having a book about the story of the 1974 US Open that recounted all the horrors that unfolded. I imagined it would be a long slog, with little joy. I’m glad to say I couldn't have been more wrong. 

The first decision we made was a good one - to play off the white tees which were around the magic 6,500 yard mark. It took a little of the sting out of the course and meant that only a couple of holes were totally out of reach in regulation.

For some reason, I had in my mind a course crafted out of a forest, where any shot off line would be hard to find and have no shot back into play. Wrong again. The rough was clingy and thick, but it was still possible to advance it reasonably if you weren’t too greedy. Often recoveries would get just short of the green leaving a good chance of knocking it on. However when we arrived at the green we were faced with some of the most devilish set-ups in the world.

The green complexes are one of the defining characteristics of Winged Foot. Most of them tilt from back to front, so where you leave your approach shot is absolutely key. The first green gives you a wonderful taste of what is to come. It’s a vast, tilting, sloping, bewildering expanse. It is impossible to play it without a sense of wonder and joy!
The 1st green at Winged Foot - a thing of wonder!

Your eyes can deceive you at Winged Foot. There are false fronts galore and the nuances of the slopes mean that playing away from the pin and letting the ball roll in will often be the smart play. It may sound odd, but I found some similarities to a Scottish links course. You can putt the ball from way out, and it may be easier to get the ball to the hole that way rather than trying to get there with a wedge.

The par 5s were all accessible; I was up on 2 of the 4 and I'm not a long hitter. Conversely the 3s are long, with 3 of the 4 being over 190 yards. The standout would be the 10th. With the pin at the back we were playing 195 yards over a valley, but a well hit tee shot was all it took to have a massively sloping 60 footer for birdie (not made!).

Founded in 1906, Winged Foot is a wonderfully historic place to play golf. There are so many great anecdotes, but the 2006 US Open added another bucketful to keep the magic alive. For us Brits, Monty's 7 iron short of the green, pitch and three putt for double lives long in the memory. For what it's worth, I did one better from the same spot on the fairway. It’s another hole defined by the green - a false front will push the ball down to a dell, there are intricate humps and hollows, and you need to be the right side of the flag to have a chance of getting down in 2.

You shouldn’t expect to shoot the lights out at Winged Foot - it’s one of the most revered US Open sites. But you shouldn’t approach it with fear like I did! Suffice to say, off the right tees (I cannot emphasise that point enough) I think that any golfer would have a great time at Winged Foot. I found it a really exhilarating place to play golf. At times your pulse will be racing, but there is also a real calm feeling out in the whispering trees.

I was lucky enough to get back to Winged Foot in September 2019, after the mercurial Gil Hanse had completed a fantastic renovation of the West Course. Bunkers have come out, greens reclaimed and the course is even better for it. As a result of the green expansion work (back to the original sizes) there will be new pin positions possible when the 2020 US Open visits. When I was there they were already well along with getting things ready for the event. The fairways had definitely come in a bit and the rough was a little deeper but I still didn’t feel that it was an unfair challenge. But boy, when they get those greens going for the pros it will be quite scary in places.

This may be the best parkland course I have played. If you get the chance to play it then definitely take up the offer(!), you won't be disappointed. It's a very strong 18 points!

BOOKING THE COURSE

Well, this is a hard one. It is a high end course which isn't particularly accessible. However, if you are really set on it, then my advice would be to look out for the charity auctions as New Yorkers are a benevolent lot and there are a few opportunities to play there every year. 

TOUR TIPS

If you are playing other courses in the area (Quaker Ridge may be the pick of the lot) then there are tips for staying locally on the Westchester page. Failing that, you are only 30 minutes from Manhattan so you can enjoy the attractions of the Big Apple before heading up. 

Play here is usually only with a member but, if your host has the time I would thoroughly encourage you to try to play the East course too. It is a more accessible course for sure, but fits into the property wonderfully. There are some I know who even prefer it to the West. If you start early enough there should be no problem getting round both the East and the West.

You can’t book a tee time on either course usually - it’s a first-come-first-served roll up on the 1st tee. Caddies are mandatory, and pretty essential when it comes to reading these greens.

This really feels like an old-school members’ club. The locker rooms are reminiscent of those in a 1950s boarding school, there are idiosyncrasies like the burnt toast served before lunch and the ginger biscuits with peanut butter after 9 holes. The clubhouse is adorned with memorabilia from days gone by and you won’t have to wait long to hear stories from the past.

I would also do a shout out to the pro shop. I think it may be the best stocked anywhere in the world. The range is huge and really well sourced. That, combined with the very cool Winged Foot logo, means you will find it hard to leave without getting the credit card out."
33,Pacific Dunes,top100,"Bandon, OR",Tom Doak,2001,Review: Pacific Dunes,Andrew Harvie,rev033_pacific_dunes_1,"“One is a curiosity, two is a destination.” Mike Keiser’s now-famous words represent the expansion of Bandon Dunes Golf Resort, where the destination began with David McLay Kidd’s Bandon Dunes, and became a golf resort with Pacific Dunes.

To this day, Pacific Dunes is considered one of, if not Tom Doak’s best and is consistently debated as the #1 public golf course in North America, alongside Pebble Beach and Pinehurst No. 2.


Opening the golf course, a 370 yard short par 4 greets golfers. Although I have heard some criticism of this hole, like it awkward or not an exciting way to start, I have no issues.


While not the most breathtaking hole here, I love the green complex, which sits into the landscape quite nicely.


The 2nd begins the journey to the Pacific Ocean with a 368 yard two-shot hole. One centreline bunker and one bunker left make it obvious where the preferred angle is, but makes for a more difficult tee shot.


From the right, the golfer plays over the short right bunker with a backstop, which helps. It does not funnel balls as much as it appears to, but will help stop balls from bouncing long. The movement in this green is quite severe; I am a fan.


A better, closer look at the green complex.


The third is the first par 5 at Pacific Dunes, playing one yard shy of 500 due west. A mess of bunkers in the middle provide a distinct left or right angle, with the left side being preferred for those trying to get home in two.


This is a lovely green complex, with some textbook strategy. Tucked into the dune, bunkering on the right corner angles the green from 8-2 on a clock, with a bunker on the left for those who layup. As mentioned, playing left of the bunkers is key to get home in two for longer hitters.


This is just a pleasant green location, which will reveal the Pacific Ocean upon arrival. Less movement than the first two (although still impressive), but a smarter green complex—in my view—as it sits up higher, exposed to the wind, whereas the first two sat down low almost on-grade or below-grade.


The 4th is our introduction to why Pacific Dunes is so highly regarded. Sure, the Pacific Ocean flanks the hole on the right, but behind us is now the 13th, which we play later. Getting a routing to have both nines to play on the major feature of the golf course in a way without long walks puts this golf course up against almost anything else. At 463 yards, this is a monster with the ocean—as mentioned—up the right, and two big bunkers on the left. The more right you can play, the better.


This green is so brilliant. Sitting low into the landscape, the big bunker on the right is blown out, with slopes and contours coming off the left side and bleeding into the green. Why is this important? Bailing out left brings a much more difficult approach to a green that almost slopes away from the golfer now. From the right, you can use the slopes to feed the ball in. A master class in angles, all controlled by the green contours.


After a brief introduction with the ocean, we head inland with the 199 yard par 3, 5th. This is a cool par 3, with a very long green with undulations akin to the ocean waves you just saw on the previous hole.


As mentioned, Pacific’s strength is its routing, bringing you to the Pacific Ocean on three different occurances. However, the separator when debating it against its contemporaries is the strength of the inland holes, which might be better than the oceanside stuff. That begins on the 316 yard par 4, 6th, among the best drive-and-pitch holes on planet earth.


Given the distance of the hole, it should be drivable, but I would love to hear stories of someone keeping it on this green. Set high above the fairway and the two massive bunkers on the left, the hole almost has a verse S shape to it. Hitting it straight to your preferred number will leave a difficult, semi-blind wedge up over the bunkers.


Playing out to the right is better, but you will not get a full wedge.


Cranking driver up near the green could work, but leaves a difficult pitch.


I have played Pacific Dunes twice, one day with 70KM/H winds, and one with no wind, and this is an insanely challenging hole in the wind. Even with no wind, there is trouble everywhere.


The 7th is a very good long par 4 at 464 yards playing back into the forest. The fairway is undulating, but no bunkers or anything, so a nice time to let loose a bit. Missing the fairway too far left or right will result in a lost ball.


This is such a great green complex. I think the picture below speaks for itself.


Another look at the green complex from 2018. This is one of the few approach shots here where I felt like I had to hit it in the air, but a nice change of pace for variety’s sake.

The actual green contours are superb, as well. I was infatuated with this hole on my second spin.


A fairly standard par 4 tee shot at the 8th awaits. At 400 yards on the nose, it is a middle length par 4.


This is another great green complex, with a reverse strategy. Instead of challenging the bunker like that at the 2nd or 3rd, playing to the outside corner actually opens up the green more. The location of the putting surface is A1.


The 9th is a peculiar par 4, but one that I like. 406 yards, we play over a ridge to a blind fairway with two fairways into one.


With a lower green and an upper green, the 9th can be played in two different ways, depending on where the turf department cuts the pin that day. Getting it on the right side of the fairway is preferred, especially to the upper green (which I believe is the more popular of the two).

Left green:


Right green:


The upper green has some impressive movement. I have never played the lower green.


The dual green sets up the start of the back nine with a lower and upper tee, although the upper tee seems to have a better view. At 206 yards, it is a longer par 3 playing back towards the Pacific Ocean with quote the backdrop.


One of the more odd choices of Pacific Dunes, but another thing to seperate itself, is the back-to-back par 3’s to start the back nine, continuing with the 148 yard par 3, 11th. A very demanding short par 3, with a narrow green pinched between bunkering, the ocean, and the hillside.


The tee shot is breathtaking here, and one of the best spots in golf. But the hole isn’t over; the green is amazing as well.

After a superb stretch of golf, it had to come down eventually. Granted, I think having interludes is an important feature of Kendrick Lamar’s To Pimp a Butterfly, so having a small interlude here does not hurt. At 529 yards, a par 4 plays around the 4th with a couple bunkers in play.


The layup is fairly chill.


The green complex is another winner, with a massive bunker short left sloping towards the green, fighting the contours coming off the dune that sits to the right. In my view, the green complex really makes the 12th. A perfect reprieve.


A better look, sitting beautifully in between its surroundings.


Why the need for the reprieve? We head to the 444 yard par 4, 13th, a beautifully difficult par 4 alongside the Pacific, with the ocean up the left now.


The green complex sits into the hillside, playing more uphill than you think. At this point, I had hit the first 12 greens in a row, so the caddie for the other people in my group started giving advice because he said he’d never seen anyone hit all 18 greens. He has now, and I am sure it has been done before, but it was one of the better rounds of 2021 for me.


The 14th is the shortest par 3 at Pacific Dunes, maxing out at 145 yards. The caddies in the group joked that Tom Doak never built an island green like his mentor Pete Dye, but the 14th is as close as he got. The green has little margin for error, wrapped with trouble. Additionally, the 14th sits exposed to the wind, high above the 13th and in the dune.


The 15th is a fairly flat and spacious par 5, measuring 539 yards.


An easy way to dunk on Pacific Dunes is targeting the back nine par 5’s with the 12th and 15th because they are less dramatic and more “plain” in presentation, but I disagree. For one, they both head in opposite directions, and given their short nature, one will generally allow the golfer to get after it and push for a birdie. Secondly, the green complexes are still superb, but before the 15th green, we still have to lay up.


What a sick green complex, with a hump short right and the green pushed up. Going for it in two is a viable option on days with the wind coming from the north, but it can be quite difficult to hit.


At 338 yards, I am still not quite sure what to think of the 16th, which continues to play much shorter than the yardage with a summer wind.


You can cut the corner, but it leaves a difficult approach to a green with some intriguing movement. The fairway is as if you crumpled up a piece of paper and tried to smooth is out again. There is no flat lies to be found here, complicating things further.


A different view of the terrain awaiting, which can either be found by cutting the corner on the tee shot of this dogleg right, or the approach shot trying to stop the ball on this somehow-firmer-than the rest.

IMG_2086.JPG
The 17th is a beautiful 208 yard par 3, notably utilizing the redan template. Play it out right and see it funnel down, but it will not get all the way back to the left, likely stopping in the right third.


Finishing off, Pacific Dunes ends on the longest hole on the golf course at 591 yards. A massive blowout bunker that sits on the inside corner of the dogleg left must be avoided at all costs.


The layup is all about not getting ahead of yourself and finishing strong. Fairly straightforward, at this point it is a test of stamina.


A beautiful green site to end the day, well bunkered with a quasi-punchbowl feel.


Run, do not walk, to Pacific Dunes, but I suspect most reading this review already knew that. This is an easy #1 at the resort for me, and among the best golf courses I have ever seen."
34,Pacific Dunes,top100,"Bandon, OR",Tom Doak,2001,Is Pacific Dunes the Best Public Course in America? It Might Well Be.,Sean Ogle,rev034_pacific_dunes_2,"I’ve spent pretty much my entire life living in Oregon. Yet for some reason, I didn’t make it down to Bandon until last November – or 14 years after Bandon Dunes first opened it’s doors.

Every year my golf buddies and I would say, this is the year we’re going to do it, and every year, time, money, or other commitments got in the way.

So when I was out at Portland Golf Club in October, and their membership director told me they needed one more guy for a November trip down to Bandon there really was no way I could turn it down.


And thus began my first trip to what some are calling Golf Mecca.

While I’ve talked to people lucky enough to go down there for a week or more, our trip was a bit abbreviated. Leave on a Monday, back on a Wednesday.  I’ll tell stories and give details of the trip throughout the 4 posts I write about the 4 courses we played, but it started by meeting in Portland at 6am and hightailing it down I5 for 4 hours until we arrived in the seaside town.

Now if you’ve ever been to Oregon, you know that November can be, how shall we say, a little dicey.

For my first trip, I was just hoping for no rain.

When we pulled through the gates and headed out to the practice range, we weren’t met with sun, but it wasn’t raining and it wasn’t that cold – which was perfect in my mind.

There were 16 of us playing Ryder Cup style: the long standing members of the club, and the new members (or non-members), which included myself.

I’d go into the whole handicap fiasco, but if you’re interested in that, see this post.

We hit our balls and after shaking off the nerves we headed over to Pacific Dunes to grab lunch and hit the first tee.

Somehow I ended up with the club champion, and the guy who holds the course record on Pacific  – Tim Hval, the former head pro at the resort.

All I could think was “God, I hope I don’t embarrass myself…”

The Course

Pacific Dunes was the second course built at Bandon and was completed in 2001 and designed by Tom Doak. I’ve always loved Tom’s designs and his minimalist nature.


Pacific is pretty spectacular in the sense that it seems like the course was always there. By looking at it, you wouldn’t have thought an ounce of dirt was moved – the landscape is that fitting for golf.

It’s got a quirky layout going out with one par 3 and coming in with 4 on the back – but that’s part of what makes Pacific Dunes so unique.

It’s highly rated on just about every list there is, including:

#1 Top Courses You Can Play (Golf Magazine)
#20 Top Courses in the World (Golf Magazine)
#3 Top 100 Public in the Country (Golf Digest)
#19 Top 100 in the Country (Golf Digest)
#21 Top 100 in the World (Golf Digest)
I don’t care who you are or what publication you look at, Pacific Dunes isn’t just good, it’s world class.

It’d be my first round at Bandon, and one that had sky high expectations.

Did my experience live up to them? Well, let’s look at the course and I’ll let you know at the end.

Hole by Hole

Distances are from the  6,142 yard green tees, which is where we played.

Hole 1 (Par 4, 304 Yards)

The opening hole at Pacific Dunes isn’t nearly as scary as it looks.

You step up to the tee and in front of you you’ll see rugged undulations, areas of sand and gorse – but no green.

It’s hidden slightly down the right.  That said, there’s more room out there than you think, so keep it left center of the fairway and consider a hybrid or wood – that should get you close enough for an easy wedge on approach.

Pacific Dunes at Bandon Dunes Golf Resort

Hole 2 (Par 4, 335 yards)

#2 is a really well designed short par 4.


You ideally want to be on the left of the fairway for your approach shot, but you have two big bunkers that you’ll have to avoid if you want to be there. Right side is safe, but will two greenside bunkers into play.

Along with reading Dream Golf before you’re next round at Bandon, I’d recommend reading Tom Doak’s Anatomy of a Golf Course. Really helps to put into perspective, why the courses are laid out the way they are – and it gives you a better sense of why they’re ranked as highly as they are.

Pacific Dunes at Bandon Dunes Resort is the #3 Top 100 Public Course in the US

Hole 3 (Par 5, 476 yards)

The first par 5 is a tough hole, even if it’s length doesn’t seem like it.

You have 3 bunkers that are more or less in the middle of the fairway, so you need to actually make shots, rather than just bombing the ball.  Left fairway is a safe bet, or if you can clear the first bunker, directly over it will line you up for the best angle into the green on your approach.


A great example of why having a caddy or yardage book is so essential at Bandon.

Also, whatever you do: don’t go short-right of the green. Took me 3 shots to get out of that bunker.

A little taste of what could be if you don’t place you’re first shot well.

Hole 4 (Par 4, 449 yards)

This is the moment you’ve been waiting for. The hole where “Pacific Dunes” really becomes the course you were expecting. A par 4 over the cliffs of the Pacific Ocean, you obviously can’t miss right. Ever.

I tried, slicing my drive, but there was a convenient little nook right around 250 yards that kept my ball from dropping in (by inches).

This hole has constantly been rated as one of the best par 4s in the world, and once you’re on the tee, it’s not hard to see why.

Welcome to one of the best par 4s you’ll ever play.

Par 5 (Par 3, 181 yards)

The only par 3 on the front, and probably my least favorite of the 5 (you have a lot to look forward to on the back). Also, one of the more difficult greens on the course.

Hole 6 (Par 4, 288 yards)

A fun short par 4 (seems like we’ve already had a few of those, which I really like). You’ll want to be in the center of the fairway edging towards the right for the best angle at a very narrow green. Too far left and not only do you have to contend with the big bunker left of the green, but it makes the green ridiculously shallow, with a big drop off on the right.

Hole 7 (Par 4, 436 yards)

Some people consider this the most difficult course on the entire property. It’s an extremely long par 4 playing 464 from the tips.  If the wind is in your face good luck reaching the green – give the course some respect and layup. That being said, there are some weird bumps and patches of heavy rough that will make finding your ball extremely difficult.

Careful you don’t layup too close to the green
Hole 8 (Par 4, 369 yards)

Another long Par 4 that often plays into the wind (we got lucky and the wind was pretty minimal). Watch out for the false front and make sure you take enough club into your approach.

Hole 9 (Par 4, 379 yards)

This starts one of my favorite strings of hole on any course I’ve ever played. 9-14 of Pacific Dunes are world class no matter how you put it.

9 is somewhat similar to #3 on Old Macdonald as you have a blind tee shot up to a ridge with plenty of room over it.

This hole is also unique in that it actually has two greens an upper and lower – so pay attention to which one is in play.

Pacific Dunes is a Top 100 Golf Course in Bandon, Oregon

Hole 10 (Par 3, 163 yards)

You start the back 9 off with one of the most specactular par 3s on the paroperty. An elevated tee plays down to a green that sits right on top of the Pacific, giving you unparalled 360 degree views.


Watch out for unplayable lies in the thick brush to the left of the green, slightly right is the safer play.

Hole 11 (Par 3, 131 yards)

Just when you thought it couldn’t get any better, Hole 11 is another par 3 and has the smallest green. Playing parallel with the Ocean, I promise this a hole (and a view) you won’t soon forget.

Pacific Dunes is a Top 100 Golf Course in Bandon, Oregon



Hole 12 (Par 5, 507 yards)

After back to back par 3s we have a reachable par 5. The biggest danger here is going to be your approach, especially if you’re trying to get home in two. There’s a big bunker guarding the front of the green, and a large mound right behind the green that doesn’t give you a whole lot of room to work with – so keep a close eye on your yardages.

Pacific Dunes is a Top 100 Golf Course in Bandon, Oregon



Hole 13 (Par 4, 390 yards)

13 gives #4 a run for it’s money as the best par 4 on the course. Playing the opposite way as #4 (meaning into the wind) two accurate shots are necessary.  This is a deep and narrow green, so consult your caddie as to where the hole location is for the day.

Also don’t forget to take a second on the tee and soak in your surroundings, golf simply doesn’t get a whole lot better than this.

Pacific Dunes is a Top 100 Golf Course in Bandon, Oregon

Hole 14 (Par 3, 128 yards)

While not right on the ocean, 14 is still a really cool par 3. Take note of the wind, as this hole can play much shorter than it’s yardage states.

Pacific Dunes is a Top 100 Golf Course in Bandon, Oregon



Hole 15 (Par 5, 504 yards)

This hole sucked…well for me at least ha. My tee shot barely cleared the gorse on the left and popped over to the next fairway. Because of my struggles aiming I didn’t get a photo of this one, so we’ll just move onto 16 🙂

Hole 16 (Par 4, 338 yards)

A couple years back Golf Digest called the 16th at Pacific one of the “18 Most Fun Courses Golf Courses in America.” 

While it’s certainly no stretch to say that, I’m not sure it’s quite as much fun as some of the other holes at Bandon.

Pacific Dunes is a Top 100 Golf Course in Bandon, Oregon



Hole 17 (Par 3, 189 yards)

The 4th and final par 3 on the back 9.

Playing about 180 from our tees I thought my 5 iron would be plenty of club – not so much. You don’t want to go short as you have a difficult and potentially steep up and down, but if you’re too long, you’re in the gorse. Don’t try and be a hero, just get it on the green.

Pacific Dunes is a Top 100 Golf Course in Bandon, Oregon

Hole 18 (Par 5, 575 yards)

While I’ve heard many people say that Pacific lacks a good opening and closing hole, I don’t necessarily agree.



I think this par 5 is a really visually interesting hole, that can be difficult the first time you play it (or every other time for that matter). Careful on your approach as there are some pretty terrifying bunkers surrounding the green.

Closing Thoughts

As a whole being at Bandon was even better than I thought it would be (is that possible?). The courses had much more variety than I was expecting, the camaraderie and vibe around the entire complex was unlike anything I’d experienced, and we had unbelievable weather for the trip.

However, there was only one thing that I’d say slightly disappointed me. What was it?

Pacific Dunes.

Don’t get me wrong, the course was phenomenal. The ocean views, unparalleled.  But, there were a couple reasons I wasn’t as wowed quite as much as I was expecting.



The first? While we were there the greens were in pretty rough shape. They were slow and pretty grown out – something I wasn’t expecting. Obviously playing on fescue is very different than most golf in North America, but the greens were in by far the worst shape of any of the other courses.

The other reason I was slightly let down, is partially because the other courses were all so good – namely Bandon Trails.

The inland course which is always rated the lowest on major polls of the Bandon Courses was actually my favorite.

I thought it had the most fun and unique holes, was in great shape, and wasn’t at all hindered by the forest landscape.

I was expecting Pacific to be far and away a better course than Trails, and it wasn’t, or at least I didn’t think so.

So while I loved all of the courses there, I think the reason I found myself slightly disappointed was because comparatively everything else was still so good. Talk about a high quality problem.

That being said, have you been to Bandon Dunes? I’d love your feedback on whether or not Pacific was your favorite?

In the meantime, I think I need another round to give a proper rating. Guess I should go back next month 🙂

Yep, that’s happening."
35,Prairie Dunes,top100,"Hutchinson, KS","Perry Maxwell, 1937/Press Maxwell, 1957",1937,Perry’s Nine,Andy Johnson,rev035_prairie_dunes_1,"It was 100 degrees outside. Since we had already walked 36 holes in the past 22 hours, we agreed that a change of pace was in order. We decided to try some time travel. We were at Prairie Dunes Country Club in Hutchinson, Kansas. Both that morning and the previous evening, we had played 18-hole rounds. All the while, in the distance, there was a low, continual din of shouting and splashing. The heat had driven a crowd of local kids to the club pool. At times, sweating in my hat and collared shirt, I almost envied them. Almost, I say, because the golf was so good. Perry Maxwell, the great Oklahoma-based architect, built the first nine holes at Prairie Dunes in 1937. Twenty years later, his son Press completed the course, but he didn’t simply build the new nine on a separate piece of land. Rather, he added three holes to the west side of the clubhouse and six to the east. In doing so, he followed his father’s plans, though there is some doubt as to how faithful he was. Today, the old version of Prairie Dunes—consisting of Nos. 1, 2, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 17, and 18—sits embedded within the modern one. A few of these holes are not only the best on the course but among the finest anywhere. Our time-traveling notion on that hot afternoon was simple: to play Perry Maxwell’s original nine.
Minimalism—by necessity and preference

The less of man’s handiwork the better a course. – Perry Maxwell Like Southern Hills, Perry Maxwell’s tour de force of championship golf in Tulsa, Prairie Dunes was a product of the Great Depression. Maxwell drew up 18 holes, but he ended up building only nine. The construction itself, headed by his brother-in-law Dean Woods, was a model of thrift. They hired men through the Works Progress Administration, used rudimentary equipment, and moved a bare minimum of earth. This approach happened to suit Maxwell just fine, as he believed in low-cost minimalism with a kind of evangelistic zeal. Speaking to The American Golfer in 1935, he said, “It is my theory that nature must precede the architect, in the laying out of links. It is futile to attempt the transformation of wholly inadequate acres into an adequate course. Invariably the result is the inauguration of an earthquake. The site of a golf course should be there, not brought there. Many an acre of magnificent land has been utterly destroyed by the steam shovel, throwing up its billows on earth, biting out traps and bunkers, transposing landmarks that are contemporaries of Genesis.” These convictions of Maxwell’s were as much financial as they were aesthetic. His trips to Great Britain persuaded him that American golf was mired in unsustainable addictions. As he put it his American Golfer interview, “[T]he majority of American golf clubs are in the red, gore of the steam shovel, blood drawn by the mound-builders. We have learned nothing from Scotland or England where the ancient and honorable game can be enjoyed on marvelous links at one tenth the admission fees, dues, green fees, etc., that prevail in the land of the free.” Maxwell’s spartan methods were well suited to tough times, and in the 1930s, when many other golf architects stopped working, he continued to design and build courses. In 1935, Maxwell met with the Carey family about building a course on the outskirts of Hutchinson, Kansas. Depending on which historical account you believe, either Maxwell spotted or the Careys showed him a stunning tract of Ice Age-forged dunesland east of town. Beneath the wild grasses, yucca, sandhill plum, and cottonwood trees, he must have recognized the undulations, large and small, that would make for compelling golf.
Since Maxwell preferred not to design from maps, he spent a month simply walking the property. “You see,” his son Press said, “he had so much ground to work with that he wanted to see it all, and from all directions. He didn’t design courses from maps. He went out in the field because he wanted to be right in the place where the game was to be played.” It was around this time that Maxwell delivered his most reprinted line: “There are 118 holes here, and all I have to do is eliminate 100.” The construction methods were rustic. Under the supervision of Dean Woods, whom Press referred to as “an old fellow who was opposed to the use of tractors,” the WPA crew built Prairie Dunes quickly and cheaply in the first half of 1937. As Mal Elliott writes in his book Perry Maxwell’s Prairie Dunes, “The construction of the course was done with teams of horses and mules, 18 in all, and slips and Fresno scrapers and wheelbarrows. There was not one piece of mechanized equipment except for the Model T and Model A Fords and trucks which took the workers to the site. The greens and fairways were cleared and scraped by teams dragging plows and scoops. The roots of native grass and weeds were all removed by hand, one wheelbarrowful at a time.”

Using simple methods at the Prairie Dunes construction site

The result was a course that, to this day, meshes humbly yet artfully with the landscape. The transitions between the manmade and the natural—the “tie-ins,” as modern architects call them—are nearly imperceptible. When Perry’s nine opened in September 1937, knowledgeable golfers, including Walker Cupper Johnny Dawson, saw it for what it was: the best nine-hole course in America. (For the historical narrative above, I relied on three books: Mal Elliott’s Perry Maxwell’s Prairie Dunes; Christopher Clouser’s The Midwest Associate; and Anthony Pioppi’s To the Nines. All are excellent reads.)
Perry’s nine

When we set out to rediscover Perry’s nine that afternoon in late June, we knew we weren’t the first. Anthony Pioppi, for one, had played the original course in preparation for his book To the Nines. Also, the members of Prairie Dunes Country Club are well aware of the distinction between the “Perry holes” and the “Press holes,” and I’m sure many of them have taken a crack at the old nine. Nor did we intend our experiment as a slight to Press Maxwell’s work. While the Perry holes are generally better (“Press did not have the imagination and vision his father had,” Jake Carey told Pioppi), the Press holes would be standouts anywhere else. A few of them, especially the slanting, tempting par-4 14th, are among my favorites on the course. Still, as we discovered, there is a special rhythm and coherence to Perry’s nine that you can appreciate only by playing it in its 1937 sequence.
Hole No. 1
1937: par 4, 415 yards
Today: par 4, 452 yards
The tough opening hole swings to the left, into the prevailing wind, daring you to cut the corner to get a shorter approach. The real fun starts at the green. From the 1930s to the present day, golf writers have spoken of “Maxwell’s rolls,” and this green is a good example of why. Here, instead of simple tiers, you see ripples that rise to a point and fall away. This style of contouring raises the stakes of the shots played into, around, and on the green: if your ball finds the correct side of a “roll,” it will collect toward the pin; if it doesn’t, it will swerve away.

Hole No. 2
1937: par 3, 140 yards
Today: par 3, 164 yards
Benched into the property’s main ridge of dunes, the 2nd is an imposing target, even if it sits only 140 (or from today’s back tees, 164) yards away. The green points to about 10 o’clock, asking for a left-to-right shot shape. The wind, however, tends to push the ball to the right, toward a back bunker where, I can assure you, you do not want to be.

After finishing on the 2nd green, we made our first deviation from the modern routing of the course. Instead of hiking up to today’s 3rd tee, we took a path to the left, through the “gunsch.” It was a stirring walk.

Hole No. 6 (formerly No. 3)
1937: par 4, 335 yards
Today: par 4, 387 yards
Right away, we saw that the forward tee of the 6th hole must have been the main tee of the original 3rd. From there, the hole unfurls around a big bunker on the left. Beyond this intimidating hazard, there is an area of maintained rough from which a sightline opens to the left portion of the crowned green. A fairway bunker on the right guards the other decent look at various pins. From the middle of the fairway, your view is obstructed by a flashed bunker that appears to abut the putting surface but is in fact 13 yards short.

The current 6th is one of several holes at Prairie Dunes that would benefit from fairway expansion. Pushing the mowing lines to the outer edges of both fairway bunkers would bring the best, riskiest options back into play.

Advantageous angles from the rough on the 6th hole at Prairie Dunes. Note also the modern back tee (bottom right) and the path to the forward tee from the 2nd green. (Google Earth)

On other holes, especially today’s Nos. 9, 17, and 18, rough has encroached on safe but less strategically desirable sides of the playing corridors. In those places, the longer grass is unnecessary;  the poor angles should be the main penalty. Unlikely as it seems, then, Prairie Dunes, one of the greatest courses anywhere, could be even better. From the 6th green, we walked straight back to another original tee that now serves as a forward tee. It’s a peaceful spot. A pair of cottonwood trees provide shade, encouraging a moment of reflection.

Hole No. 7 (formerly No. 4)
1937: par 4, 440 yards
Today: par 5, 512 yards
The 7th hole is now a short par 5, but Maxwell designed it as a long par 4. Once you find the fairway, you can either lay up to a generous area short of the green-side bunkers or trust your downwind approach to hold a green surrounded by treacheries of undulation, sand, and shrubbery.

Hole No. 8 (formerly No. 5)
1937: par 4, 395 yards
Today: par 4, 468 yards
The best known hole at Prairie Dunes tumbles over some of the most impressive terrain on the property—huge, lurching waves of land. The usual left-to-right wind diverts tee shots toward a stretch of gunsch where, if you find your ball, you will have no view of the green and no real hope of hitting it. Only with a powerful drive will you avoid a blind second shot. Even then, you will likely be hitting from an awkward lie to a severely canted green perched high in the sand hills. This is golf as pure adventure.

Hole No. 9 (formerly No. 6)
1937: par 4, 400 yards
Today: par 4, 452 yards
If the 8th hole shows off the Hutchinson dunesland at its most dramatic, the 9th emphasizes its subtler contours. A closely mown swale to the left of the green influences tactics all the way back to the tee. To be able to aim your approach away from this hollow instead of toward it, your tee shot has to ride the wind to the left side of the fairway without sailing into a large, gnarly bunker. The more you hedge away from this hazard, the worse the angle of your second shot becomes. Complicating matters, toward the safe, right side of the fairway, the undulations grow bigger, increasing the likelihood of a lie that will conspire with the wind to force your approach left, toward that green-side basin.

Hole No. 10 (formerly No. 7)
1937: par 3, 160 yards
Today: par 3, 185 yards
Like the 7th hole, the 10th runs with the prevailing wind. And as on the 7th, Maxwell tests your ability to hold the green by placing bunkers short. When the pin is on the right, you have two options: 1) drop a downwind mid-iron just past the bunker on the right and somehow keep it from running through, or 2) go left and accept the inevitability of a triple-breaking, 60-foot lag putt. When I think of a prototypical scalloped Maxwell green, this one comes to mind. From the devilish hummock center-right, to the merciful central channel, to the repelling edges front left and back left, every section makes for delightful chipping and putting.

Hole No. 17 (formerly No. 8)
1937: par 5, 510 yards
Today: par 5, 523 yards
Here is where our time travel briefly failed: Maxwell’s original tee was just behind the 10th green, and the tee shot played diagonally across the dune ridge between Nos. 17 and 18. There was visible room to the left, but position A was to the right of the hog’s back in the fairway, blind from the tee and close to death in the prairie grass. From there, you had a chance to go for the narrow, elevated green, guarded by bunkers left and a drop-off right. We were unable to hit from the original teeing ground, however. In expanding the course to 18 holes, Press moved the 17th tee to the east. Now it is a straightaway hole—still excellent, but not as fun.

Hole No. 18 (formerly No. 9)
1937: par 4, 370 yards
Today: par 4, 390 yards
While relatively short, this finishing hole, Perry’s 9th, is a culminating trial of nerve. As on the No. 17, the garden spot is on the right, but a strong right-to-left slope makes it hard to hit. Also, since this section of the fairway is concealed form the tee, and since the wind presses scarily toward the dunes on the right, a bailout to the left just feels better. It results, however, in a blind approach that would have been even more uncomfortable when the bunker pit short of the green had sand in it. As a finishing hole for match play, No. 18 at Prairie Dunes is ideal. It can yield birdies as readily as X’s.

The course of time

We finished Perry’s nine as evening advanced, and in spite of the heat, we felt invigorated. In our morning round that day, we had taken in the full breadth of 21st-century Prairie Dunes by playing all 18 holes from the tips. Even at a “mere” 6,900 yards, it felt (at least to me) like a championship brute. The green-to-tee walks were long, backwards, and frequently uphill. From the elevated back tees, I found my field of vision dominated by gunsch rather than short grass. It was a great, stern examination of golfing ability. We anticipated that Perry’s nine would be a different experience, but we didn’t know how different. Rather than a test, it felt like a charming adventure. As we followed the old transitions from hole to hole, the routing fit together like a puzzle. It returned to the clubhouse three different times, offering moments of respite before lighting out again for the dunes. The original landing zones came into focus, inspiring one of us to pull the head cover off his persimmon driver. Our imaginations wandered continually back to 1937: in the middle of a vast continent, an ideal course on ideal land, with wind—sometimes mild, sometimes fierce—generating variety day to day… Golf courses wear their histories, some better than others. At Prairie Dunes, time has been generous. The modern 18-hole course is wonderful, but within it sits my favorite nine-hole course in America, lovely and exacting and resilient, still available to the adventurous."

The course, or at least 9 holes, opened for play in 1937 and Perry Maxwell laid them out. Maxwell believed absolutely that “the golf course should be there, not brought there,” and he surveyed the 480-acre site day after day for weeks before making any decision on the routing. Perry’s son, James Press Maxwell extended the course to 18 holes in 1956.

Naturally, the end result is a course that is natural, and although there’s no salty taste of the sea on your lips, there’s everything else that is essential to make a perfect day’s golf. First of all there is sand and sand to spare, secondly there is the ever present Kansas wind – the energy from which is being harnessed liberally across the state – thirdly the land pitches and rolls in a delightful seaside style and fourthly the holes are designed in a thoughtful, cunning and strategic fashion. The sum of this is pure golfing heaven.

Writing in Tom Doak's Little Red Book of Golf Course Architecture, the author commented as follows: ""What makes Prairie Dunes special is the severity of the greens and the wonderful choice of green sites. Interestingly there are a lot of uphill approach shots, which a lot of people don't love and some don't like about my own work, but those green sites are what makes the course challenging. It's also a special place in terms of atmosphere... it takes some effort to get there, but they are always so hospitable to people who have made the trip to see them, and they are really humble about what a good course it is because they aren't there to impress anybody, they are there to enjoy it themselves.""

Prairie Dunes is a private club and casual green fees are not accepted. If you want to experience this stunning inland links course (renovated by Bill Coore and Ben Crenshaw in 2004) and you are willing to make the long journey to Hutchinson Kansas, we suggest you ask your home club to prepare a letter of introduction. Who knows you might find yourself teeing it up at the 1st “Carey Lane”."

“At least we know the PrecisionAire works.” The relentless rain poured the entire time. Two rain jackets and three sets of gloves later, at some point I just accepted I would be soaked the rest of the round. Every step was a slosh of water from the shoe. A gust of wind would greet us every now and then, my body would shiver with the cold reflexively. It certainly wasn’t warm. The mixture of cold and constant rain was too much for most every other group, who finally started their march off the course. We offered that option to our member host but he wouldn’t hear of it. We were finishing the round even if a tsunami hit us. Besides, at least we know the PrecisionAire works.
There was a perverse focus out there that day. I loved the course, what I was seeing and how it played. I was playing well as an added bonus, the 2 iron of all clubs obeying my commands and cutting through the water before running as far forward as it could. And indeed, the PrecisionAire was working, the greens rolling terrifically well while the fairways stayed in nice order. It was the rough where the rain imparted its harshness. That wet rough, almost like hitting out of a wet shag carpet, would wrestle the club head from you with evil motive. My flight left in a few hours and I had no idea how I would even dry off, as the course was still dealing with a devastating fire, destroying one of the iconic clubhouses in the game. There was no locker room to speak of. I ignored all of it. None of it mattered while I was out there, taking in the course, interacting with it. The impressiveness of all the green space, rolling and heaving, much more enjoyable and sophisticated than I was expecting. I was glad our host shared that same tenacity. It’s only water, it’s only cold. There are more important matters at hand.
It was by far the wettest and likely most extreme weathered round of golf I have played. And one of my favorite of the season.
After the round, I managed to change in the pool house, where heat lamps were put out. I stood next to one, almost hoping my hair would catch fire for the warmth. A glass of bourbon in hand, its nourishing warmness nipping away the cold. I then bid adieu and found a grocery store, where I snagged a few plastic bags. I took all my wet apparel, put them in the bags and shoved everything in my golf bag. All I could do was hope I would get home in time to dry everything before rust or mold started in. I finally began to defrost as the rental car blasted heat on the way to the airport. By the time I was at the airport sitting at a bar with some soup, I was already back to normal, relishing the two days of extraordinary golf I had, already comparing and contrasting Oakland Hills to the other great Ross courses I have played. Already realizing the place surpassed anything I was expecting.
The Monster. Monster Monster Monster Monster Monster Monster Monster Monster. Monster. MonSter. MonsTer. Monster Monster. mOnSter. Ok we got that out of the way. The course is famous for how Ben Hogan characterized it after his U.S. Open victory in 1951, that legacy forever enshrined from then on. A venerable tournament venue, one of the nation’s anchors of the game. Host of the 1924, 1937, 1951, 1961, 1985 and 1996 U.S. Opens, the 1972, 1979 and 2008 PGA Championships, 2002 and 2016 U.S. Amateur, 1981 and 1991 U.S. Senior Open, 1929 U.S. Women’s Amateur and 2004 Ryder Cup. Now set to host the 2034 and 2051 U.S. Opens, 2024 U.S. Junior Amateur, 2029 U.S. Women’s Amateur, 2038 U.S. Girl’s Junior Amateur and 2047 U.S. Amateur. There is no doubt the course is championship worthy. Hogan anointed its challenge decades ago and the history of these competitions are the rubric of America’s golf folklore. The legacy is self evident.
So what happens when the clubhouse is in tragic ruins, the trophies, memorabilia, regalia, no where to be found and the rains wash away the crowds? What happens when it’s nothing but you, the course and the elements? The course has no where to hide, that’s what. You find out a lot about it, as well as yourself. An infinite baptism as the skies flooded, the rawness of self, course and game laid bare by and by as we went on. And it came to be the last thing on my mind was the Monster. Or the trophies, championships, and legends that had walked and played the same fairways and greens as I. It was Donald Ross. And yes, Hanse. And all the green hills and slopes and. . . greens. The creeks and shrines of sand. The rain wore on, the waters washed but in the end, the genius remained. Aye, the genius, that’s what I was after.
In 1916, Donald Ross began here. Essex County had just been completed and Number 2 was 10 years old. Seminole was a few years off, as was Aronimink, while he worked on Inverness at the same time as here. The original design featured an array of diagonal cross bunkering that enhanced strategic plays of angles depending on how the golfer confronted the bunkering. The land stretched every which way with a nice balance of openness and well placed trees. Even in its early days, it was one of the longest courses of its time, just over 6,800 yards for the 1924 USO. This grand scale of Ross remained for the 1937 USO as well. Then came the 1951 USO, and the USGA and Robert Trent Jones . . . and the Monster. It’s important to note what RTJ did and didn’t do as part of his work in transforming the course for that major. He did move bunkers so they were in play at the tee landing areas, he did increase bunkering around the greens to create a more precision aerial exam and he did change the Eighth and Eighteenth into par 4’s, only a parcel of yards shorter than their par 5 yardages. And yes, he added trees. Lots of them, narrowing those playing corridors to surgical strike levels. RTJ did not, however, touch the greens or the routing. Yes he toughened the course by reducing acceptable lanes of play and landing areas, all but eliminating the ground game. But the touchstone of Ross splendor, the routing and greens, remained.
Rees followed in his father’s footsteps, focusing on bunkers and narrowing. He deepened them and further constricted playing corridors. The course was a stiff, mostly one dimensional test where long, straight and aerial were required for a good score. There were no options, there was little strategy. You could either hit the shot or not. Otherwise, you paid a stiff price. Yet like his father, the routing and greens remained.
“If it’s cold, windy and rainy I’m out.” Gil Hanse apparently wouldn’t have joined us that day. A professional wuss who happens to design golf courses, he, Jim Wagner, and their team came in to do their thing. My article “Golden Gil” https://golfadelphia.com/2019/12/27/golden-gil/ quoted Hanse discussing his work here: “We’re undertaking a restoration of the South Course at Oakland Hills. Donald Ross did the original, of course, and it was Robert Trent Jones who did the renovation that created “The Monster” Ben Hogan conquered in winning the 1951 U.S. Open. Rees Jones later revised his father’s work. The plan is to restore kind of a hybrid of the Ross and Jones designs, the best elements of each. The course will be closed for nearly two years beginning in 2019, but when we’re finished, without a doubt it will be a Monster again, albeit one a little different than the one Hogan brought to its knees.” Hanse’s goal was to actually toughen the course by shifting the challenge it presented while making it more fun and accessible for the everyday golfer. Gil widened entry points to greens and reinvigorated the absolutely world class ground game that can be had here. He also opened up the course significantly, allowing the terrain to once again flourish, which uncapped all of the strategy and options that were incorporated into the land long ago by Ross. While the greens had never been re-shaped, they had shrunken over the years so Gil expanded them to their original size, brought them to USGA specification and installed PrecisionAire systems under each. The hum of those systems during my round in concert with the rain drops was enough to lull me to lay down in one of those golden bunkers and rest my eyes for a spell. This process with the greens meant each was laser surveyed and scanned three-dimensionally, then cored. RTJ2 has decried the work to the greens as a ruination but it’s typical nowadays, and necessary for long term preservation considerations. Works of art undergo similar processes, as do classic cars and houses. The Seventh green was relocated to its original place along with the creek. Bunkers were reduced in numbers but increased in size. With all of this, Gil paid mind to narrowing the fairways where the tour players would land their tee shots, embracing the Jones’ stiffening concept, while widening others where it made sense depending on the contours. This was done while restoring the cross bunker configurations, instead of having each fairway flanked by bunkers on each side.
I’m contrarian by nature and have no problem admitting there are times I get sick of hearing about Hanse. Hanse this, Hanse that, Hanse is coming to work his magic, Hanse shows up all smart, charming and humble, everyone loves Hanse. We get it. And while I enjoyed Gil’s work at other Ross courses like Plainfield and Aronimink, I was only lukewarm to the more recent Pinehurst 4. All of this hesitancy dissipated as I was playing here, however. Gil, Wagner and their team really did some special work. It took me by surprise, grabbed me by the collars and shook hard. At first I noticed the bunker sizes and just how large they actually were. That naturally led to views beyond the bunkers where the fairway, rough and greens seem to bounce along for miles. The concepts of width at places like Sand Hills, Rolling Hills and even Pinehurst 2 were here in a similar type of application. The terrain is sophisticated in its natural typography and now the golfer is free to use it as he wishes, yet the strategy in how to go about it, as well as the wickedly deceptive greens that seem easy enough until you see the ball roll unpredictably is what the course does so well now. The ground game was indeed extraordinary, one of the better I have come across recently. Bradley Klein wrote so eloquently and spot on of the course, “Now you see open, rolling terrain with much larger swaths of sand along a powerful horizontal scale. Much of that is due to Ross’s routing. It makes use of certain nodal points that gather in a kind of golf energy and concentrate one’s attention”. Yes!
The course was a delight in how you had so many choices at each shot and were never truly out of a hole no matter how poor the last shot. There are very few absolute penal elements such as out of bounds, large water or other forced carries. Most of the time, one is met with the mammoth bunkers, the mischievous rough or the hills, where one may need to deal with unfortunate lies or blind shots when out of position. The golfer never stops golfing. There’s also so much green and grass to work with which is a double-edged sword. Those who may simply come up woefully short on their approach at least have the wide entry point and green to coax the next shot close. Those who end up woefully sideways may wish they were put out of their misery with a drop or stroke and distance. The scale and width did indeed create a particular golf energy Klein refers to above. No longer a course of despair, the golfer stays engaged no matter what. There’s so many opportunities for redemption, it is inevitable. I was expecting more of a championship venue focusing on that long and straight mantra, but Oakland Hills South is so much more. It’s a dramatic and fascinating member’s course that could host a major with not much more than a day’s notice.
It breaks in to my top 10.
I long for the day I am able to get here under better circumstances. Perhaps with the sunlight spreading to those green hills and a few foursomes here and there leisurely walking the fairways, complimenting those well-hit shots while lamenting the others. Some time, the clubhouse will return in its Georgian magnificence framing the whole scene while the creeks will be much tamer, trickling here and there, quietly. Yet it is during the times of duress one gets a keen sense of the true nature of man, or golf course for that matter. So many months removed from the rain, cold and wind, I’m grateful to see the course in such circumstances. We got to look deep into the character of the other.
The First is a 428 yard par 4 (from the Blues). A slightly elevated tee shot opens up the round and the bunkers introduce their presence early on, making sure you understand their dominant role. Visually, it appears as if the bunkers crowd the fairway but once among them on ground level, you begin to see how much space there actually is. The fairway narrows a bit between the tee landing area and the green at which point it widens once again. That first green runs back to front with a diagonal shelf running in the center. The ball just rolls. The greens are large and at times it seems as if there is no amount of space or time that can get the ball across them and into the hole, but adjusting to the scale is part of the experience here.

The green
The Second is a 511 yard par 5. Like the First, bunkers dominate the viewscape from the tee. It seems inevitable hitting into them but focusing on carrying the center ones directly in front will find fairway easily for most tee shots. Indeed, once we reach the fairway, we see the river of green flowing up to the green while a barrage of sand comes at us from the left. After some narrowing a bit further ahead, the green is on top of the hill with the fairway feeding right into it.

The Second

A bit shorter
The Third is a 190 yard par 3. A nice 4-5-3 start has us around the world quickly. The brilliance of the bunker positioning throughout the round comes out here a little bit more with the center bunker at an angle. This creates those visual issues with depth perception that were evident on the prior two holes while ensuring a bail out short isn’t a guaranteed safe shot. It also obscures just how much room there is at the front of the green to play with. A large bunker flanks the green on the entire left side while a smaller albeit riskier on is on the right. The green is wide and set at an angle, running towards that large left bunker.

The Third


Just short of the green

To the left
The Fourth is a 424 yard par 4. Moving to the a corner of the property, the fairway starts to turn and fall to the left at the tee shot landing area. Bunkers are on either side and in play off the tee, first right then left. Like the tee shots we’ve seen thus far, this one is semi blind and keeps us slightly off kilter. The green is below the fairway and most every approach will be coming in from above. The entry point is as welcome as come be, so even those out of position can at least ponder whether there’s a way to feed the ball on. Of course, hitting the green is only half of it; the other is using the flat stick to navigate the wondrous world of those fast moving careening greens.

The Fourth

The green coming into view

The green
The Fifth is a 430 yard par 4. Another off kilter tee shot that falls below us slightly. A large bunker on the left warns us to avoid that side but it is the most advantageous approach angle, so getting as close as possible without going in is a good idea. The fairway then ends at a creek and picks up on the other side. It’s a touch approach no matter where you are. The bunkers dominate visually, with a larger one taking up a lot of the space on the right, then there is a small center line one sliced into the space just short of the green and another off to the left. The golfer may be tempted to carry all of this to the rear of the green but the back side is no good and will be left with a green rocketing away from them. That center line bunker also complicates any ground game proposition. It’s possible, but aerial precision is probably best, or laying up short and doubling down on one’s ability to get up and down could be smart depending on where the second shot is from. It’s a tougher hole, a transition of sorts from the warm introduction of the opening quartet, walking from our host’s parlor to the bar area for a round of shots. How we handle that change in hospitality will unfold over the next few holes.

The Fifth

The right side, beginning of the fairway

After the creek approach shot territory
The Sixth is a 344 yard par 4. A shorter par 4 all uphill where the gargantuan bunkers assert their presence. The right center bunker strongly suggests something less than driver off the tee. There’s also a larger bunker to the left and about the same distance out that suggests the same. Strategically, the golfer can decide to lay up short of the bunkers or take them on for a shorter approach and missing off to the right isn’t the worst thing either, but even short of the bunkers will end up being a short iron into the green. The green moves like a tidal wave back to front and left to right, the movement of which should be considered in every shot where the ball will land on to it.

The Sixth

Approach shot territory

The rear
The Seventh is a 369 yard par 4. The host now expects us to be well acquainted and pleasantries are well behind us. It is time to address any pressing matters, the staff instructed to keep out as things get sorted out as needed. The bend of the creek among the hills is used brilliantly here. First, it crosses the fairway at the start and at an angle, so the further right the tee shot, the further it must go to carry. How the creek cuts across the higher portion of the fairway and turns on the right side, however, means any tee shot on that side will need to avoid two separate section of the creek and carry even longer that if one simply ends up left to left center. In other words. Do not go fucking right off the tee. The three bunkers off to the left may steer one away from that side but if I were to play this hole again, I would embrace that left side, away from the creek. The creek comes in from the back left of the green and moves alongside it, across the fairway altogether until reaching the right side of the tee landing area I just so eloquently described, before moving back towards center and cutting across the fairway yet again. Alas, the approach will likely need to carry the creek where it crosses the fairway on the high portion, near the green. The green itself is almost like a hillside running as fast as the creek itself downwards. Anything above the hole becomes exponentially tougher to handle. The configuration of the creek, bunkers, contours and green, and its impact of visuals, depth perception and playing structure is fascinating. I can’t even tell which of the 15 strokes I enjoyed most here.

The Seventh

Looking back

Looking back at the rear of the green
The Eighth is a 460 yard par 5. We continue the march uphill, gently yet firmly. This is possibly the first tee shot we have a chance to see the fairway laid out before us from the tee. The bunkers remain large and looming on both sides and while the tee shot may seem as futile as filling up a bucket with drops of water, we relent and hit it anyways. The fairway ripples and climbs to the green, which climbs even more steeply towards it. Thank goodness we have an extra shot here to set up the approach. There are a series of bunkers up the left side we need to avoid and the right side opens up the entry point and green, yet it takes that extra stroke to get over there and take advantage. Firm yet gentle is apt here. The hole never feels like a brute yet some how its scale and climb start to wear on the golfer and he trudges up the hill to the green. The Monster. Instead of a more direct slaughtering as many faced before, perhaps now that monster is more of a silent killer that intrudes slowly without our knowing, like stress or cholesterol. My par here felt like I wrestled the world to its knees, before I realized we had most of the round to go.

The Eighth

Looking back
The Ninth is a 219 yard par 3. The longer par 3 carries over swaths of rough and a grouping of bunkers shared with the First with the practice green and clubhouse in the background. The area before the green may be tempting to hedge on but the bunker in the center keeps everyone honest to go for the green instead. There is some safety towards the rear of the green more or less, which could be used to get the ball move back towards the front, but that will need to be a very healthy long and true shot in. As with most holes we have encountered thus far, there is a lot more room between and amongst the bunkers than appears at first blush.

Taken from the practice green, the tees are on the hill to the right of the path
The front nine does well in looping around efficiently while playing with the assorted creeks and hills as brilliantly as possible. There is no quirk, there is no eye popping intimidation or penal elements; there is a gentle green giant elegance that simply asserts itself quietly and ensures each shot is plotted out carefully or else the strokes sneak upon us. The sequencing is also of note, starting out in warmer tones before slowly tightening up to the last. Every hole was solid and I am loathe to rank them but if pressed, would say 9, 7, 1, 5, 6, 3, 2, 8, 4.
The back nine starts with the 446 yard par 4 Tenth. At this point, my so-called water proof high tech rain jacket was soaked through. I had a spare in my bag, so put that on but it only held for a few holes as the rain intensified. Most of the back nine would be played in a head to toe sop. I changed one set of rain gloves for another and they too would pool up shortly. So be it. The course was too intriguing to worry about such matters as warmth, dryness or sanity.
A little less width that we have grown accustomed, the bunkers flashing and signaling where the tee shot should go and where it should not. It was immediately apparent to me that the fairway shaping is a lot sharper and pronounced, hills and ridges much more sudden. Indeed, the fairway moves up and down a couple times over some ridges, the approach will likely be on the longer side and possibly a blind shot from a lie you wish could be better. The green is on the same hill as the Eleventh tee, Seventeenth green and Eighteenth tee, Ross using the best parts of the property as much as possible.

The Tenth

A bit closer
The Eleventh is a 415 yard par 4. The fairway funnels between bunkers on both sides before us on the tee, so one must figure out whether to utilize the width of the shorter shot or take on those bunkers in some way. After the bunkers, the fairway actually drops and curves left heading to the green, which is uphill and mostly out of sight. The fairway shaping is dramatic and demands attention, the approach must climb and soar to heights above and the green is deep yet narrow. I found it one of the more challenging approaches.
After you remove your ball from the hole here, take a moment and reflect on how you enjoyed the last couple holes. You just played what Ross felt were his finest consecutive par 4’s ever designed.

The Eleventh

The wonderful fairway shaping

The pin, mocking us from above
The Twelfth is a 520 yard par 5. On top of the same hill as the green from the hole prior, a refreshing panorama of the course reveals itself. Our fairway is on the other side of rough and below, a lone tree on the left and water on the right. Bunkers are then left then right before the fairway widens before the green, which sits just a bit above. Nice and large, it cradles those approaches coming in long and short, moving a few different directions but back to front in general.

The Twelfth

Left side of the fairway

Approach shot territory

A bit shorter

The green

The Thirteenth is a 158 yard par 3. Ross usually liked to have one shorter par 3 on his courses and this is it for here. Surrounded by bunkers and requiring an aerial attack, the green has a lower left and upper right tier to further ensure the tee shot is a sufficient test in accuracy proficiency. The rough is heavy outside of the bunkers, so recovery shots will all be fairly tough, as the golfer still needs to pay attention to the tiers and pin position, even more so since he is already a stroke down.



The green
The Fourteenth is a 472 yard par 4. Yeah, par 4. I’d be lying if I didn’t admit the rain, cold and wet was starting to wear me down a little. I couldn’t get the ball in the air off the tee on the hole prior and trudging through all that wet rough to the green was not fun. A par 4 almost 500 yards was among the things I was not hoping to encounter at that moment. Towels. I became fixated on towels as they danced in my head, just rooms and bales of towels in all their dryness. I knew the tee shot needed to be drilled for a chance to regain some composure. The others in my group got their shots out there, so just copy them. With ran and wind beating on me as I started my backswing, I bore down and walloped one. That’s all I needed. The cold, pain and despair disappeared. After the bunker on the right, the fairway starts falling towards the green. What Ross did brilliantly here is placed many of the fairways against ridges so that a lot of the hole remained suspenseful from the tee. That is certainly the case here. After the ridge, the fairway reveals itself, then widens once again after the fairway bunker on the left. The green is sunken from the fairway and quite wide, likely one of the larger greens of the course. The approach will definitely be on the longer side, yet the green and area before it can be used to get the ball close. Indeed, the flatter ball flight of the two iron was helpful, staying on course then landing and sprinting and jumping towards the green, ending up close enough for me to think about sinking it. It’s a great hole in how its length seems a bit deceptive opposite to what is usually the case; it seemed to play much shorter than the stated yardage.

The Fourteenth

Moving down the fairway

Short approach shot territory

The green

The Fifteenth is a 362 yard par 4. A bit of trees here, especially on the left, guarding the inside of the dog leg. Likewise, pools of bunkers are congregating in the same area, all of it signaling to stay as short as possible off the tee, which then would leave you with miles on the approach. The green is uphill as well, further pressing the issue. The bunkers are a great example of Hanse fusing the old with the new. Ross’ original bunkering at the inside of the turn is there, as well as RTJ’s positioning more towards the center of the fairway, and Rees’ bail out areas off to the right. Those can opt to carry then altogether and getting as close to them as possible is ideal, all of it creating a daunting and thoughtful tee shot. After the turn, a view of the green opens up but the pools of bunkers leading up to it must be accounted for. There is much more room between them than it appears and even more room up at the green. My 2 iron gave me one of the more memorable shots of the round as it carried all of the trouble and settled 10 feet from the pin for a look at birdie, which I missed.

The Fifteenth

Approach shot territory

A bit shorter

Looking back
The Sixteenth is a 406 yard par 4. An elevated tee shot on the same ridge line where the green prior is situated, the fairway and horizon are both laid out before us. The hillside off to the right conceals just how wide the fairway is over there, as well as the water a little further out on that side. Staying left or left center off the tee is ideal. Moving down to the fairway, we see just how large the water is. It’s essentially a small lake and must be carried from pretty much any approach shot to the green. The golfer can decide on a shorter carry over the water at the expense of ending up short of the green, which is below the fairway and makes any of those shots a bit more delicate in trying to avoid crashing into the water.
At first I felt the hole seemed a bit out of place with its demanding forced carry and size of the water hazard, but it’s as Ross designed it. No doubt it brings a different challenge with the finality of that watery grave and towards the end of the round, has the potential to unravel scorecards or matches.

The Sixteenth

Moving down the fairway

The green, on the other side

Short approach
The Seventeenth is a 192 yard par 3. A marvelous longer par 3. The green sits on top of the hill, its immense size concealed from the tee while expansive sandscapes cover a lot of the front and sides of the hill. The rear falls off abruptly into rough with little room behind it. The shot will play much longer than its yardage, with even well hit shots that seem to have enough fall short and rolling back down the hill. There is plenty of room to miss but of course the recoveries up the hill will all come with their assorted complications. A tremendous par 3 where the acumen with the longer clubs in the bag have no where to hide.

The Seventeenth


Looking down at me, in disdain
The Eighteenth is a 487 yard par 5. A longer dog leg right bending around the perimeter of the property back to the clubhouse. The tee shot uses the same hill as the green prior and the Tenth green, Eleventh tee, heading out to one of the more straightforward fairway presentations of the round. The fairway pivots at the right fairway bunker, which is grand in its stature and sets the tone for the rest of the hole. The bunkers gather with more interest closer to the green where the slopes and contours abound, dancing about the larger bunkers and rising up towards the clubhouse. It’s a fitting closing scene, the green serving as the grand subtle stage while those about the clubhouse are the audience. In shivering soaked numbness, only able to manage the most brief, slightest grin, we take our bow and promptly seek the refuge of dry.

Looking back from the green

From the practice green behind
The back nine neatly loops around the other side of the property than the front and has stages of challenge. The opening sequence is tighter with bolder shaping before widening in scale, then length and challenge ramp up before the last, which eases up a touch to allow the golfer a little freedom to handle the accompanying pressures of closing things out respectfully. They are all strong holes, with my ranking of them 17, 15, 11, 14, 18, 10, 12, 13, 16.
“I rarely find a piece of property so well-suited for a golf course.” The sprawling hills with meandering ridges and creeks settling on a great expanse. Always at that proper balance of interest without being too dull or extreme at any point, the land lends itself brilliantly to the game, as Ross recognized way back when. The course is a grand elegance; a parade of dizzying yet pleasant slopes on which the ball arches and careens along the magnificent fairways to the gigantic greens. The fairways climb dramatically and even glide nonchalantly at times to those greens, striking a lively expansive ground game throughout. Hanse and Wagner certainly enhanced the ability of the course to remain a monstrosity of challenge while becoming even more sophisticated and engaging for its members. The challenge has shifted to be sure; the golfer must now heed to the whims of the land and navigate its contours large and small. The behemoths of sand rise and fall rhythmically and must be navigated carefully. The hills and ridges dance in delight, revealing and concealing at their leisure. It’s a wonderful mixture of parkland tenets with the strategy and ground game one usually encounters at the links. It’s a unique, all world identity, one that took me by surprise, joyfully. It has the ability host championships and challenge the game’s greatest in a distinct manner while exuding a wealth of interest that would make any of us want to loop around again and again in engaging splendor.

38,Oakland Hills (South),top100,"Bloomfield Hills, MI",Donald Ross,1917,Oakland Hills (South Course): About as Storied as It Gets,Sean Ogle,rev038_oakland_hills_2,"I wasn’t sure if Oakland Hills was going to happen – but man did I want it to.

One of the most frequently asked questions on the trip was “How did you get on the private courses?”

Medinah was pretty straight forward, Oakland Hills, not so much.

The common answer: “It was a friend of a friends, dad’s business partner’s, business partner” – and that pretty much sums it up.

I’m learning that a big part of the fun of going for the Top 100 is all of the cool people you meet along the way and the interesting circumstances that will have to present themselves in order to get on the courses.

After playing Medinah the week prior, I was kind of expecting Oakland Hills to look a lot like that.  Long winding entrance way with very grandiose feeling, looking grounds.

The reality wasn’t actually quite like that.

When you pull up to Oakland Hills there’s a small sign that says “members only” and then a very short driveway up to the bag drop in front of the back of the club.  The attendant took our clubs and we parked the car and made our way to the mens locker room.

Here you don’t use cell phones, and you don’t put your shoes on in the parking lot – you’re given a locker close to the member who is accompanying you and you do it in there.

The clubhouse at Oakland Hills is hands down the most beautiful I’ve ever been in.  From the locker room to the mens bar to the mixed dining room, it was all first rate.

Our member hadn’t arrived yet, so we made our way to the range which was very nice, but surprisingly short. My first reaction was “I bet the pros could hit it 150 yards past the treeline.” I later found out that during tournaments like the Ryder Cup and PGA Championship that they use part of the North Course for a driving range – along with Parking.

Oakland Hills Country Club is one of the Top 100 Golf Courses in the US
Well manicured, but not exactly long…

Denton showed up about 10 minutes later and we got to know each other a bit before heading to the putting green.

This is when I got scared.  The hole I’d picked to putt on was right at the crest of a hill. I knocked it up there to within an inch, and then watched it roll back down about 15 feet…3 times.  I finally learned I could hit it above the hole and it would roll back down in – that was fun, I just prayed that the entire course wouldn’t be so evil.

I was pretty excited to hit the course as this is my first Donald Ross design  and is one of the most storied golf courses in the world, having hosted:

6 US Opens (1924, 1937, 1951, 1961, 1985, 1996)
3 PGA Championships (1972, 1979, 2008)
US Senior Open (1981, 1991)
US Amateur (2002)
Ryder Cup (2004)
If that isn’t an unbelievable collection of tournaments – I don’t know what is.

For everyone’s sanity we decided to play the white tees, which still measured 6,512 yards.

And with that we stepped up the to the first tee on the 20th best course in the US.

Front Nine at Oakland Hills South Course:

Let’s do this thing.

Hole 1 (Par 4, 382 yards)

What you immediately notice about the first hole at Oakland Hills is just how narrow the fairways are.  Bunkers within reach surround both sides and just beyond that are trees.

We all sprayed our drives a bit, and mine was what appeared to be the least damaging lying just off the fairway in the rough.  This was until we walked down and checked out the rough.  Thick.  Immaculately maintained, but thick.

After having what was probably the best warm up I’d ever had, it was as though I’d forgotten how to play golf on this first hole.  May have been because the gravity of the course I was playing had finally sunk in.

A triple bogey is not how you want to start off when playing one of those “once in a lifetime” rounds.

Hole 2 (Par 5, 485 yards)

A shorter par 5 dogleg left, but not one I was even remotely thinking of going for in 2 as my goal now was just to keep the ball in play and try and make some pars.

The tee shot is slightly blind with heavy bunkering along the left and at the dogleg on the right.  Best shot is to keep it left center of the fairway, and then play smart shots all the way into the bunkered and elevated green.

Hole 3 (Par 3, 164 yards)

The first par 3 on the course was also the site of one of my best shots of the trip.

I pulled out a 6 iron and picked an aggressive line directly over the front bunker.  I cleared it by about 2 feet and the ball must have rolled within an inch of pin, stopping about 2 feet away.  Putt in for birdie.

This is one of those times where you can’t help but think “I bet at some point during a tournament Jack didn’t make birdie on this hole…”  Nevermind the fact the pros were probably an extra 50 yards back.

Hole 4 (Par 4, 410 yards)

Another dogleg left with a narrow fairway. Slightly downhill approach with heavy bunkering.

Hole 5 (Par 4, 394 yards)

This was the point where I was starting to get concerned about all the dogleg lefts, which definitely do not play well to my fade.  My driver was off all day, and this was one of the worst examples of it, slicing it hard and almost getting it to the 6th fairway.  A creek runs through at about 280 out which on this day wasn’t reachable for any of us.

There was a lot of extra room around the fairway and green here, I can only imagine the masses on a tournament day.

Hole 6 (Par 4, 343 yards)

One of my favorite holes on the front 9.  Similar to 11 on the back, this is a short par 4 with bunkers everywhere, and you guessed it, yet again another narrow fairway.  3 wood or iron is the play here, as you don’t want to be in any of the bunkers on this course.

Hole 7 (Par 4, 358 yards)

If you’re not driving the ball well, this is a scary hole. Water all along the right and bunkers all down the left.  I played 3 wood and landed it middle of the fairway about 140 out.  It felt longer from the tee than it actually played.

Hole 8 (Par 5, 462 yards)

Short par 5, but don’t mistake that as easy.  Straight away with very narrow fairway, bunkers everywhere and a pretty severely elevated green. Play 3 smart shots here, and this could be a good birdie opportunity.  Long is better than short on the approach as those bunkers are exactly where you don’t want to be.



During tournaments the course plays at a par of 70, this hole along with 18 are turned into par 4s.

Hole 9 (Par 3, 196 yards)

My second attempt at a hole in one on the course.  The bartender at the bar we were at the night before said “Remember, on 9 it may look shorter, but you’ll need all of the distance on this one and probably an extra club more.”

Playing 205 out, I heeded his advice and opted for my 3 hybrid.  I wish I had a photo of where the ball landed – 3 inches to the left of the pin.  It stopped about 4 feet from the pin and in all of my nervous glory I missed the putt and settled for par.

Back Nine on the South Course at Oakland Hills:

The back 9 is well, just as tough as the front…

Hole 10 (Par 4, 418 yards)

They don’t make things any easier once you swing around to the back. I learned this the hard way. I was flying high after shooting a 43 on the front and playing some of the best golf of the trip.

The back 9 would be a different story entirely.

A long par 4 with a fairway that sloped in just about every direction imaginable.

Also notice that one tree on the left, if you ever see it, tell it I want my ball back. There aren’t many places at Oakland Hills to hit it in the trees – but apparently I was determined to find every single one of them.

Hole 11 (Par 4, 384 yards)

Possibly my favorite hole on the course. Short par 4 with an S-Curve fairway and elevated green. Pop it over the left bunker to get some roll down to the base of the fairway and have a relatively short approach.

Hole 12 (Par 5, 526 yards)

Fun par 5 that requires a smart 2nd shot. Bunkers on the left and trees on the right with a sharp dogleg.  You probably won’t reach the dog leg off your drive, but aim to the left side of the fairway to give yourself the best angle at getting close after 2.

Depending on where you are you can cut the corner over the trees to get it closer to the green, but unless the pin placement is left, it probably won’t do you a whole lot of good. Elevated green with lots of fun bunkering.

Hole 13 (Par 3, 152 yards)

Hit the green or else.  That’s pretty much all there is to say about this par 3. If you aren’t on the green, you probably won’t be liking where you do find yourself.

Oakland Hills Country Club is one of the Top 100 Golf Courses in the US

Hole 14 (Par 4, 448 yards)

The #2 handicap hole and the only one that I would say is just plain unfair.  Measuring 456 yards (or just 20 yards shorter than a couple of the par 5s on the course) this hole is long and difficult.


By the time I did finally reach the green, I had one of the more fun putts of the day that was a double breaker downhill from the front of the green.  Luckily it was one of the better putts of the day and allowed me to save my triple.

A note about the greens – personally I didn’t find them to be as difficult as I was expecting.  I thought the greens on the River Course at Blackwolf and even on our prior days round at Forest Dunes were a little bit tougher.

Looking back though I think that was a bit of a facade.  I just was finally putting halfway decent at Oakland Hills. Dan had at least one 4 putt and a bevy of 3 putts, and he said of all the courses he played in Michigan, that OHCC by far had the most diabolical greens.

Hole 15 (Par 4, 370 yards)

While still a dogleg left, this is another fun one.  With three giant bunkers right in the middle of the green you have to be smart off the tee. Best placement is left of the bunkers without being in the trees.

This gives you a manageable approach shot to the uphill green.

Oakland Hills Country Club is one of the Top 100 Golf Courses in the US
No big deal, just a trio of bunkers right in your landing area 🙂

Hole 16 (Par 4, 377 yards)

The signature hole on the course, and a daunting one from the tee. You need to get your ball far enough out to have a good play at the green, but even a moderate slice will leave you wet.

The approach isn’t any easier as the water wraps farther around the back than you think, and well, there are bunkers everywhere else.

Oakland Hills Country Club is one of the Top 100 Golf Courses in the US

Hole 17 (Par 3, 176 yards)

The last par 3 and arguably the most difficult.  Playing 185 and very uphill, it’s another case of “if you aren’t on the green, you probably won’t be happy.”


 


In my case I was the only one to land on the green, and I still wasn’t very happy as I found this to be one of the most difficult greens on the course.

Oakland Hills Country Club is one of the Top 100 Golf Courses in the US

Hole 18 (Par 5, 467 yards)

We end with a solid chance at birdie on this short par 5. Downhill off the tee and then back up on the approach, the 18th green nestled at the base of the clubhouse is quite a sight and a somewhat sad one at that, as it meant our round, and effectively the trip had come to a close.

One of those rounds you simply don’t want to end..
The member who took us out, Denton, told me on the 14th that we had to stay for lunch to try their home brewed IPA.  Being from the Northwest and a bit of a beer snob, there’s no way I could say no to that.  What I wasn’t expecting was the choice between their typical IPA and one aged in Woodford Reserve bourbon barrels – this became a no brainer.

Bourbon aged beers are some of my favorite, and this was easily one of the best I’d had. A totally unexpected surprise to see at a historical golf club near Detroit. I would have had 3 of them had I not had to immediately drive 5 and a half hours to Milwaukee to catch my flight to San Francisco.

Overall I actually enjoyed my round at Oakland Hills even more than I expected to. Although we played the front 9 at a fairly breakneck pace, and it wasn’t the most beautiful of weather days, the course was a lot of fun.  It rewarded you for hitting good shots, and when you did hit those good shots, it truly felt like an accomplishment.

It’s not hard to see why this course has so much history, and I just hope that one day I’ll be able to make it back and try and bring the “Monster” to it’s knees once again."

There are these nodal high points about the course I swear reincarnated my golfing soul throughout the day. There’s the clubhouse, which looks down upon the front nine in its valley. We sat in it and watched the storm come in, darkness descending mid morning and relentless with its shreds of water. Many left certain the day was lost but for some reason, I was never worried. It would pass. And so it did. Then there’s the hilltop of the Seventeenth green and Eighteenth tee. I felt a resurgence and the game seemed so easy and full of life. Sign me up for a couple rounds more. And the higher up greens, where the lines seem to call to me as a friend. The sun and countryside and splendid summer solitude were at their height. It seemed the closer I got to the sun, the more I felt in tune with the game.
My friends, the height of summer was upon us and I was right where I needed to be.
There are three, maybe four courses I yearn to visit and they’re not likely the ones you may think. I would choose these course over many others, even some many would think I’m insane for passing up. But I have my reasons and am confident that those I have in mind are rich and enlightening in experience. Crystal Downs was one of these. There are very few courses where Mackenzie and Maxwell designed together, with Maxwell also crafting the greens but they are among the best American golf masterpieces one can take in. Among those, there are even fewer that have been left relatively preserved through the decades. In fact, Crystal Downs may be the only one in such a preserved condition, as there are only two others I can think of that have not fared so well. JC Melrose in Philadelphia fell victim to a road being constructed through it and while it’s still around and has some great features, the road has taken its toll. The other is Augusta National.
Both of these designers are among my favorite and their separate designs are likewise remarkable. Yet there is something I feel is extraordinary when they teamed up. It is rare when two colossal talents in one field or another decide to collaborate and they find a way to elevate their craft. Mackenzie and Maxwell found a way and Crystal Downs is one of those rare instances where a symphony of talent and wonderful natural setting orchestrated together for absolutely sublime golf.
Perhaps those nodal points reached out to them as well.
Starting as a nine hole course in 1927, Mackenzie and Maxwell were persuaded to come examine the site as Mackenzie was on his way back to England after finishing Cypress Point to transform it into an eighteen hole course. Upon seeing the land, the trip to England was delayed while they worked on the design and routing. Maxwell returned the next summer and headed up construction, which included the greens. He continued to return each summer in that capacity until the course was completed in 1933. The club and course remained essentially as designed for the ensuing decades. Content to remain a quiet, relaxing club for its small membership that resided nearby, Ben Crenshaw visited in the mid 1980’s, which is also around the time Tom Doak moved to the area. Doak has worked on some of the greens (Second, Eleventh, Thirteenth and Fourteenth) and there has been some tree work but the course remains very much as it was when Maxwell looked upon it that summer of 1933. That is an extreme rarity nowadays, a welcome one indeed.
The front nine is situated in a valley of sorts, all of which can be seen from the clubhouse. Exposed to the elements, its low profile with extraordinary fairway contours as the routing moves about the valley and makes use of a prominent ridge before climbing back up the hill to the clubhouse. The routing ensures each hole is distinct from the other and not just distinct but pleasantly memorable. The greens, however, the greens are among the best I have played, elevating things from memorable to immortal. Movement that is true and balanced while visuals playfully deceive, all without over doing it. The front has a heathland feel to it while the playing structure is almost four dimensional, as the holes can be played from almost any angle and the lack of unplayable terrain between the holes adds to this. The back nine is mostly an out and back affair, moving to the higher meadows. Parkland elements introduce themselves yet the wide, rise, fall and twisting of the fairways maintains similar elasticity as the front. The variety remains with its sequencing and the closing duo crescendos in drama by using one of the more severe ridges for the Seventeenth green and Eighteenth tee. The round finishes at the base of the hill upon which the clubhouses sit, which await as you make one final climb, the reward of the splendid lake views there, always.
The course is rich with romantic character. The golfer continuously comes across inspirational views and shots, then walks on to greens that are even more so. Yes there is challenge and strategy and excitement yet there’s this romanticism that pervades and makes the round exceptionally transcendent. I felt that it was how the beautiful forested setting and distinctive hills frolic with the craftsmanship of the design in the best symbiosis possible, so that one enhances the other and leaves us with one of the more treasured cathedrals of our game.
The plan was for 36 holes. Not even a rather large morning storm was enough to deter those plans, which then turned into playing a nine hole course with an 8:50 p.m. tee time. You have to love those long Summer days. After the storm, the sun came out with resurgence and the course drained almost instantaneously. Summer grace in spades.
The First is a 460 yard par 4 (from the Blues). The course is before you and we are to enter into it, head first, to the fairway below. The fairway rises, so the approach will likely be substantial no matter how sound the tee shot is, which the wind will likely batter around anyways. They say here that missing left is a bogey while missing right is a disaster, but I’m not sure they have a saying for the golfer who misses right, then left. Well, the 25 foot one putt helped shore that up, surely inspired from the outstanding green that sits above the fairway. It is deep and falls off on the left, running back to front and right to left in general. A remarkable opener. Golf Magazine has it as one of the best par 4’s in the world. No disagreements here.

The First

Looking back
The Second is a 425 yard par 4. We turn around but remain on lower ground than the First for the most part. Usually downwind yet a bit uphill, there are large yet shallow bunkers on either side the tee show must contend with. This bunker configuration is similar at the green, guarding each side at the front. The green moves back to front and has no hesitation with seeing your ball roll off its sides, particularly the front, so deftness with the putter is advisable.

The Second

The Third is a 191 yard par 3. Even with the trees in the background, we begin to realize just how much wind factors in with every shot. That backdrop actually gives the wind something to bounce off of, which leaves our tee shots in fits. There’s a merciful apron short of the green for those that can live with themselves for wimping out while the green runs at an angle some what perpendicular to the tee. The recovery shots were what amazed me, as the range of possibilities and situations seem to be endless. The green moves off of the hill on which it sits.

The Fourth is a 409 yard par 4. A dog leg right for the most part where the tee shot runs the risk of running through the fairway on the left side, so your can put some left to right movement on it or take on the bunker on the right. I actually prefer the latter as a tee shot landing high right will then fall left, all while getting closer to the hole. One must take a moment in this fairway to admire the swales and ripples that stretch to the green. It’s one of the memories that I come back to often when I think of this place, envisioning the ball bouncing along about it after that tee shot, then again and perhaps again as the golfer makes his way to the green. The green sits slightly above and with the hillside of the fairway, the right side is subject to the ground game while the left side is more raised and a pitch is more likely in order. The green has some delightful interior undulations while the overall right to left pull is likely in every roll.

The Fifth is a 353 yard par 4. Looking back on it, it was so fitting that the storm rolled in as we played this hole. Yet another that Golf Magazine regards as one of the best par 4’s in the world, the tee shot should leave little doubt of this. A ridge is before us with bunkers about its face (the trio of them in the center are known as the, “Three Sisters”) and our charge is to carry it, some where. That some where is up to the golfer, with the caveat being the more left you go, the longer your tee shot must be to clear the ridge and shorter your approach. We hit our tee shots and walked up to the ridge when the siren to come in sounded. The thunder ominously rumbling above, we were able to examine the green in the distance before we were saved with a couple carts picking us up. As we walked in to the clubhouse and I looked out the window, the course disappeared in darkness and moments later, the throngs of water and roars and flashes of light put on a furious display.
It was as if it never happened as I stood over my approach shot a couple hours later, my ball exactly where I left it. The ridge falls left to right so hides a little bit of the green on the left side because of that, yet this gives us a cue as to where to favor the approach and the direction within which to expect the ball to move upon landing. Indeed, there are bunkers off to the right to collect those that don’t mind that left to right movement. Another long putt made here. I was in tune with the greens, my golf psyche intuitively appreciating the craft it had the fortune of experiencing.

The Sixth is a 382 yard par 4. The ridge is used again for the tee shot here and like the hole prior, decisions must be made. Carrying the ridge means a nice short approach in yet the more adventurous among us may opt for the right side line, which confronts a steeper side of the ridge and requires a longer carry. Bunkers on the ridge face here should give everyone pause, as the “Scabs” will likely lead to a lost stroke unless the golfer receives a fortunate lie and can pull off the shot. The green is the largest on the course, moves right to left and is free of greenside bunkers.

The Seventh is a 335 yard par 4. We have been essentially switching back and forth in this valley but this only shows that switchbacks are not created equal and some times, yield the best holes. The prominent land features are used creatively yet a number of times, ensuring that the unique land gives its best. Here, we tee off at the end of the ridge ahead, which drops down to the lowest grounds of the course. The base of where the ridge and these hills meets formed a natural bowl of sorts, which made for a truly remarkable green site. The tee shot does not need to be driver but may result in a blind approach if not far enough out. Indeed, the view of the green depends on the position of the tee shot while a tree on the right adds to this visual equation. There is some rough before the green on the lower ground, so that the approach must come in high. The green boomerangs around the end of the ridge, which bowls at either end. Bowls at either end. Unbelievable. Leave me here with a putter and wedge and a couple balls for eternity.

The Eighth is a 550 yard par 5. It is time to make our way back up to the heights of the clubhouse and what better way to do so than with what has been regarded as one of the best par 5’s in the world by Golf Magazine, and me. It all starts with a blind tee shot over a rise of jagged undulations. This is just a preview of the fairway contours, which are some of the best one can lay their eyes on. The tee shot is subject to their inherent randomness, as is the second shot. Only pure experience can start to figure out the best areas and lines here but the goal is to climb the hill. The green is above and smaller than one hopes, so approaches in must be exact and account for the whims of the hillside. The hole can be played countless ways and presents a myriad of characteristics in full. The challenge of the lies and hill, the strategy of placement and using the terrain to one’s advantage, the drama and inspiration of its heights; the crescendo of the front nine is before us and it is legendary.

The Ninth is a 175 yard par 3. An uphill tee shot with the clubhouse looking on. The green actually moves from front to back, so a tee shot getting up the hill only finishes half the battle; it must do so without enough on it to send it off the back. The bunkers on the right are no where anyone wants to be, as the hillside looms and could send the ball back down the cliffside. Likewise, this is one of those greens where care with the putter is a good idea, as overly aggressive putts could go back down into the valley with ease.

The Ninth

Looking back to that valley

The front nine moves about the valley exceptionally well and yields nine all world holes without a weak one in the bunch. I would rank them 4, 7, 6, 5, 1, 8, 3, 2, 9.
We arrive at the steps of the lower clubhouse. The views are unavoidable as we pause a few moments, then we descend back into the valley.


The back nine starts with the 395 yard par 4 Tenth. The tee shot drops down to the fairway and is generally inviting but it’s the approach we should focus on. The green is above and moves from left to right, back to front, fairly deliriously. The left side of the green is the mark, near the bunker on that side. The right side and front are liable to get slippery about the edges.

The Tenth

View of the green from the Eighteenth tee
The Eleventh is a 196 yard par 3. The back to front movement of the green and its tiered nature can cause absolute terror, especially for those shots ending up above the hole. The bunkers above the hole follow this theme and the fact I was able to get out of one of them staying on the green and not going all the way down the hill was probably one of the better shots/luckier breaks I had all day.

The Eleventh
The Twelfth is a 430 yard par 4. The longest green to tee walk is here, where we climb up the rest of the hill and the trees clear to the meadows that comprise most of the back nine. The fairway dog legs to the right off the tee and there used to be a Beech tree that was an aiming point but it is now gone. The trees on the right must be cleared for a look at the green on approach while the fairway runs right into the green, bunkers on either side and below grade. It’s a deceptively tough green to handle on the approach despite the room short and front. It’s a combination of the angle in and the direction the green runs as far as I can tell.

The Twelfth

Looking back
The Thirteenth is a 484 yard par 4. A similar left to right tee shot is ideal here to get around the trees and move the ball ever so closer to the green with the left to right cant of the fairway. Every yard matters, as the approach is one of the more challenging of the round. The green is tucked away at the far edge of a hill, with significant dip short of it and a bunker hiding on the high left side. Pin position determines the dynamics of the approach, with rear pins needing a hearty shot to that back side or a more surgical strike around the center that will fall correctly down to the rear half. Front pins will need to confront the left to right tilt on approach and with the flat stick, making it a bit tougher because of the movement. It’s a hell of a par 4 coming at the right time.

The Fourteenth is a 147 yard par 3. An uphill green with native grass between tee and green. There are seven bunkers lurking around the green, many of which cannot be seen from the tee. The rear ones and the sides above the pin bring the most concern, as the back to front movement can get complicated quickly.

The Fourteenth

The green, from the left

The Fifteenth is a 327 yard par 4. We turn around for home at this point. The green prior gives glimpses of just how close we are to Lake Michigan, albeit high above. The course is situated on a narrower isthmus between Lake Michigan and Crystal Lake. The wooded terrain shrouds views of the water in most areas but every now then, especially when the wind is up, there are brief windows of just how resplendent the longer views of the area are.
As for the hole, the tee shot must carry native foliage as the fairway bends to the left a little. A bounding tee shot is very helpful and those that reach the swale can have to roll to the other side ideally, yielding a much shorter approach. The shorter the approach, the better, as the green is diabolical, moving right to left and generally doesn’t like golf balls on it. The bunker positioning keeps in this theme of diabolism, one at the lower left and the other high right and actually, the entire high side. Make the shot to this green a good one.

The Sixteenth is a 588 yard par 5. Long and a bend left, this hole takes us the rest of the way through the high meadows. The fairway is a bit narrower than we’ve grown accustomed and aside from the tree line on the right and native grass on the left, our charge here is to bellow the ball a long ways. It is not until we reach the green that the bunkers start, encasing the green that sits a little below the fairway. The green is on the smaller side and more deep than wide, falling back to front and left to right.

The Sixteenth

Looking back
The Seventeenth is a 311 yard par 4. Transitioning from the high meadows into the hills, the closing duo is an impressive crescendo. The tee shot must be pondered. It will be to a right to left moving fairway that climbs abruptly to the green. The widest area seems to be at the start of the fairway, which leaves a longer approach but the green should be visible. A favorable wind could bring the green into play off the tee for some while others opting for a longer tee shot will likely have a blind short shot to the green. As for the green, it is deep yet narrow and no one would call it all that big. It falls off the sides into bunkers and the front, down the hill and likely further away than your approach. It’s a hole full of thrill and excitement, as well as strategy and grace under pressure. A great short par 4.

The Eighteenth is a 400 yard par 4. The fairway wraps around the hills to the right while the tee shot is elevated. One can see the clubhouse on top of another hill in line with the tee. The tee shot brings a lot of temptation to try and cut the fairway but the hillside is a lot larger than it looks so avoid the tempts. The fairway below moves uphill to the green, a gathering of bunkers guarding it all over. There’s also a lot of right to left movement that demands attention on approach. Learning my lesson from the first round, I gave it that attention and was able to close my time here with a par.
The ladies had just finished one of their tournaments and were making their way to the upper clubhouse. Music faintly reached us down the hill into the valley. The upper clubhouse yields the best views of the lakes and despite the spirited revelry, those views still imparted a good sense of calm. It seemed to be yet another nodal high point and as we lingered and finally came back down to the lower clubhouse, I realized the height of the summer came both figuratively and literally. The far side of the season was now upon us. The music plays on.

The back nine uses higher reaches of the property and continues with yet another series of outstanding par 4’s while the others are not far behind, all of it leading to a dramatic finish. I would rank them 17, 13, 15, 18, 10, 12, 11, 14, 16.
Generally, Crystal Downs is a wonderful golf course. It strikes a remarkable balance between its strategic, varied playing structure and beautiful setting, which evokes a pleasantly engaging experience. The fairways are its foundation with their contours and cants, which lead to infinitely interesting greens that have a spiritual fulfillment all their own. Its challenge is all encompassing but is presented so exquisitely that there is never any consternation, even when ensnared in some of its tougher chapters. This is largely due to its hazard placement and type, which always provides alternative avenues of recovery and those areas where there is no chance, the golfer intuitively understands his shot had no earthly reason for going near there in the first place and is fine accepting the consequence. It’s a splendid display of our game and the members have done well to preserve it in such a touching, simplistic manner that is rare to come across nowadays.
I only hope it stays as I left it for ages to come.

61,Atunyote Golf Club,non100,"Vernon, NY",Tom Fazio,2004,"Atunyote Golf Club At Turning Stone (Vernon, New York)",Bill Satterfield,rev061_atunyote_golf_club_1,"The Takeaway:  Clearly the king of the three courses at Turning Stone, Atunyote boasts private club level conditioning and facilities. While the relatively flat ground makes it difficult to create a highly engaging design, the course features one solid hole after another devoid of any gimmicks and results in a quality test. Atunyote is the kind of course you'd happily play time and time again which helps it be one of New York's best public tracks.  Grade B What to Expect:  Atunyote (pronounced ""uh-DUNE-yo"") is the most heralded layout at Turning Stone though it is located about five miles off site from the resort. The former PGA tour stop (2007-2010) produced notable winners Matt Kuchar and long baller Dustin Johnson and was also the host of the PGA Professionals Championship in 2006 and 2016. The course is characterized with generous fairways, white sand bunkers, and pristine conditioning. Much more forgiving than the Kaluhyat course, the parkland layout at Atunyote will allow you to occasionally spray a shot and still have a chance to salvage a par although there are still plenty of bunkers and the occasional water hazard that will cost you for being sporadic. The course is relatively flat and thus an easy walk for players that would elect to do that while some waterfalls and wide variety of trees adds to the visuals. The most expensive of the Turning Stone courses, a visit to Atunyote feels more like a trip to a private club with a grand entrance, complimentary access to lockers and the practice facility, and great service. Individual Hole Analysis Signature Hole:  11th Hole – 230 Yard Par 3 – Fazio delivers a stern test on the 11th with this lengthy par three over water. Leaking a ball to the right is death with a bunker catching balls coming up short and a stream drowning balls beyond the sand. The ideal play is a fade that starts at the left edge of the green and works its way over the inviting entrance to the putting surface. With water coming into play over the next few holes, do everything you can to keep your ball dry. 11th Hole at Atunyote Golf Club at Turning Stone (230 Yard Par 3) Best Par 3:  16th Hole – 177 Yards – The final par three at Atunyote plays to a well protected pear shaped green where attacking the pin in the front third will require deadly accurate work while the back third is less protected and features a much larger target. Fazio loves to doll up his closing holes so you'll find more sand around the green coupled with some flowers around the tees to bring some additional aesthetics here. 16th Hole at Atunyote Golf Club at Turning Stone (177 Yard Par 3) Best Par 4:  15th Hole – 442 Yards – One of my favorite holes simply because it rewards the player that can successfully shape their tee shot. This dogleg right features a bunker on the outside of the turn and is the perfect target for a player that can fade the ball off the tee. After successfully putting your drive into play, you are faced with an approach shot to a green that is shaped like the fairway and bends to the right away from the player. Two bunkers front the putting surface and call for an aerial shot to carry the sand and stick the green. Fazio designed Atunyote for championship caliber play with the bunker and hazard placements as well as the green contours, and the 15th is a good example that rewards strong play. Best Par 5:  12th Hole – 538 Yards – The best hole on the property is this reachable par five. A creek carves between the tee boxes before the fairway sets out on a journey towards the green with a pond flanking the right side for the entire length of the hole. A big tee shot can bring one of the three fairway bunkers into play while staying short of them will reduce your chances of getting home in two. The kidney shaped green represents the furthest right portion of the hole as the putting surface leans out in the water in a peninsula like fashion. This design requires plays to ask themselves a Clint Eastwood question, ""Do you feel lucky?"" 12th Hole at Atunyote Golf Club at Turning Stone (538 Yard Par 5) Birdie Time:  14th Hole – 385 Yard Par 4 – The only par four under 400 yards at Atunyote is the dolled up 14th that features a creek running down the left side and terminates into a waterfall and pond next to the green. While the waterfall looks completely artificial, it is nice to have some additional character considering the flat terrain that prevails at the course. Drives under 300 yards from the back tee will stay short of the lone fairway bunker on the right and leave a wedge shot into the green. This is a great chance to take dead aim at the flag and try to hit one tight. 14th Hole at Atunyote Golf Club at Turning Stone (385 Yard Par 4) Bogey Beware:  9th Hole – 469 Yard Par 4 – The closing hole of the front nine is a bear. With bunkers on both side of the driving zone, you'll have to thread your tee shot while still managing to put enough zip on it to leave a reasonable approach distance. Most players will be hitting a mid to long iron on their second shot and will have to contend with hitting it high enough to reach the raised green while managing to miss the deep bunker lurking right of the putting surface. Bailing out to the left leaves a chip from the rough back towards the bunker. Properly judging the spin can be a challenge so getting aggressive may result in more pain than relief. Taking par here deserves a nice treat at the turn while carding a bogey will put you in company with most golfers for the day. 9th Hole at Atunyote Golf Club at Turning Stone (469 Yard Par 4)

62,Atunyote Golf Club,non100,"Vernon, NY",Tom Fazio,2004,Atunyote Golf Course Review,The Original Golf Blogger,rev062_atunyote_golf_club_2,"Atunyote is a parklands style golf course that deserves the accolades it has received as one of the best public facilities in the United States. Atunyote currently stands at 55 on Golf Digest’s Top 100 Public Courses list and is number 64 on Golf Magazine’s list. Designed by Tom Fazio, Atunyote was the site of the PGA Tour’s Turning Stone Championship from 2007 to 2010. (On a side note, this is the third PGA Tour venue I have played. The others were Colonial and Torrey Pines). Atunyote is one of three 18 hole courses at the Oneida Nation’s Turning Stone Resort and Casino. A view of the Approach shot at Atunyote’s fourth. Fazio’s design is relatively straightforward. What you see is, for the most part, what you get. Strategy and lines are fairly clear to the thinking golfer from the tee and there are no hidden surprises. Atunyote’s fairways are wide but undulating. Fairways curved gracefully left and right, but there were only a handful that could really be described as doglegs. While there were few club-shifting elevation changes, the entire course was constructed on gently rolling terrain. Some sixty bunkers dot the course, but aside from the greenside hazards, few pose a real threat to a player who plans appropriately (emphasis on planning). Aside from the par threes, none of the holes require a threatening carry. In all, it’s a generally friendly course. I can’t imagine anyone cursing Fazio’s name during a round. The difficulty really lies in its length. Stretching to 7.315 from the tips and playing a strong 6,561 even from the whites, Atunyote asks for consistently strong shots from tee to green. The back tees play to a 75.8/143; The middle, 71.7/134. The fourteenth at Atunyote is a 385 yard par 4 My favorite hole was the 385 yard par 4 fourteenth (351 from the middle). Playing uphill, it has a creek along the entire left side, and a bunker at 250 out on the right. The green is set on a plateau behind a rocky waterfall. A well played tee shot heads left just short of the bunker, which then offers a clear shot into the green, avoiding the need to lob a shot in over the waterfall. My tee shot was not well played, though. The ball leaked left, putting me near a rock by the creek. I had to play out right, then pitch up to the green. The ninth at Atunyote is a 468 yard par 4 Another great hole was the 468 yard par 4 ninth (418 from the middle). The tee shot forces a player to squeeze between bunkers left and right. From there, it’s an uphill shot to a plateaued green. What makes the hole interesting is that Fazio’s design makes it look longer than it really is. Turning Stone pro Robert Todd, with whom I was playing, told us to avoid looking at the card or sign as we approached the tee. He then had us guess whether the ninth was a par four, or a five. I guessed correctly, because it was clear to me that there was just a single landing zone; a par five would have had two target areas. The two other players in the group thought it was a par five. A view of the clubhouse from the twelfth fairway. Conditions on the day I played were as fine as any course I have ever played. That’s a large part of what makes Atunyote so special. From the first tee, I felt a vibe, a sense that I was playing at a highly exclusive club. Atunyote is a pretty course, with lots of attention paid to details such as flower beds, cart paths and undergrowth. The care given this course is just amazing. Part of the reason that it is in such good shape is that — by design — Atunyote gets relatively little play. Atunyote also has one of the most spectacular practice areas I have ever seen. There’s a standard driving range, but there’s also an area that lets you practice shots from uneven lies and from a “fairway bunker.’ The short game area has stations for practicing from various distances. It was simply amazing. Pay attention to the tee signs and yardage book as you play. Each hole is named for a native bird species, and a short description of its habits and habitat are provided. The eighteenth is the Bald Eagle, or Atunyote in the Oneida language. There was just something magical, surreal, otherworldly, about Atunyote that I’ve felt on few other courses — Forest Dunes, perhaps, or Arcadia Bluffs. I don’t know how to explain it. But it’s something that I would love to feel again. Atunyote is part of the Turning Stone Resort and Casino, a terrific entertainment complex located just north of Syracuse, New York. It is one of three eighteen hole courses on the property. Two of the courses, Kaluhyat and Shenendoah are directly adjacent to the casino. Atunyote is a short ride away. The resort has eleven restaurants, twelve nightlife and lounge spots, three spas and fitness centers, and a theatre which brings in top talent. There are 268 rooms in the hotel and more in the adjacent “Lodge.” I stayed at the Lodge in a 550 square foot suite. Amazing. Every meal I ate at Turning Stone was excellent, as were the drinks. The staff from the front door of the hotel to the “cart girl” on the course were uniformly friendly and helpful. This would be a great place to take your significant other for a weekend excursion. Of course, the Resort makes its money with gambling. I’ve never been to Las Vegas, so I can’t compare Turning Stone to that, but I can say that it is exponentially more impressive than other Indian casinos I’ve visited."
63,Poppy Hills Golf Course,non100,"Pebble Beach, CA",Robert Trent Jones Jr.,1986,Updated Course Review: Poppy Hills Golf Course,Bogeys Across America,rev063_poppy_hills_1,"I’ve been looking for an excuse to come back and play the “new” version of Poppy Hills since it reopened from its major renovation in 2014. I made a point to play it not too long before it closed. You can read that review from the summer of 2012 here. Pictures were tough that day because of heavy morning fog, but it will show some differences in the course presentation. I finally had the chance to return last Friday afternoon. I had a 3:00 twilight time. I was paired with another single and we were both walking. Cart rates are very expensive here and the course is now cart path only like the Pebble Beach Resort courses (Poppy is not part of the resort, though). This course is hilly and a tough walk, but I’ve always opted to walk at all these courses anyway. It just seems better to enjoy the beautiful surroundings. We went off right behind a group of 12 (three foursomes). They were all goofing around in some sort of friendly competition, so they were not playing fast. One of the groups was really slow. Our round took about 4 hours and 50 minutes. A lot of the renovation at Poppy Hills was spurred by a desire to use less water to maintain the course while also improving drainage, inspired largely by what they did on the Pinehurst No. 2 course before the last U.S. Open that was held there. Original designer, Robert Trent Jones, Jr. and his team worked closely with the NCGA to reimagine the course and make the following changes. This list is pulled directly from the Poppy Hills website. Sand cap the entire golf course to improve drainage and foster firm, fast and fun conditions year-round. Eradicate rough, promoting imaginative shot making both through the air and on  the ground Renovate all teeing areas and relocate bunkers. Re-design, rebuild and reseed all green complexes with bentgrass and softer contours. Widen fairways and reduce angles of doglegs. Soften contours to help the course sit more naturally into the site. Add naturalized waste areas and pine straw throughout the course, bringing the forest more into focus while reducing irrigated turf from 82 acres to 62. Reveal a natural creek that was buried during original construction. Alter the yardages of par 3s to create more flexibility for setup. Indeed, it was quite a project and most reviews of the renovated course I have read have been very positive. I was a little reluctant myself because I really loved the old course. It was very difficult with tighter doglegs, hilly terrain, nasty bunkers and insane greens. I was afraid they would alter it too much. Honestly, three of those four things I listed still apply. The only thing I really noticed was that the wider fairways definitely softened up some of the sharp doglegs from before. Some trees were removed and obviously there is no more rough other than some small collars on the far edges of fairways and around bunkers. Positioning is still crucial on almost every hole, but there’s a little more room to work with than before. Otherwise, I actually might argue that the current course (at least as it played for me on Friday) is more difficult than before. This has to do largely with the newer turf that plays very firm. It is meant to be firmer and faster than the soft, fluffy grass they had before. However, it is still fairly new turf that will take quite a few years to fully mature, so I think it will soften up a little over time and ultimately improve the playability of the course. The wide, hilly and firm fairways now provide extra roll-out on drives, but that’s not always a good thing as the ball naturally feeds toward the low spots. Those low spots are generally inhabited by deep fairway bunkers, waste areas, beauty bark/pine straw or hazards. Sometimes that extra yardage helps and sometimes it doesn’t. The toughest aspect of the course right now is the greens. They are incredibly firm. Unless you get pro-level spin on your approach shots, they won’t hold much. I was joking that I might be able to stop a wet hacky sack from 10 yards with a 64-degree wedge, but that’s about it. The greens were big and undulated before and the newly shaped greens are just as intense. With the firmness of the surfaces, the idea now is to force more links strategy and allow for more run-up shots where you can play the contours. You would have to play this course a lot to figure out all the right strategies and slopes for each green. At the same time, there are many false fronts and the ball doesn’t always release like you’d want and expect from a links course. It’s tough to judge even the shortest of shots and it really gets in your head. Through the course of my round, I got away with a couple bad shots that ended up good. Overall, though, I’d say I hit many more shots that I thought were good, but ended up in trouble. On the first hole, I had a short pitch (maybe 40 yards). I landed it on the front third of the green and it catapulted all the way off the back edge and down into a hazard. The green was so firm and there was no rough behind the green to stop it. That one shot messed my head up for the entire round! You have to be able to adjust your thinking and execute different types of shots around Poppy Hills. Some people will appreciate that and others might be frustrated by it. I fall somewhere in between. Aesthetically, I like some of what they did around the course with the new waste areas and redone bunkers. They didn’t take away from the natural beauty of the original course running through the hills and trees. Some holes are framed very nicely now, especially on the back nine. I thought the back nine definitely looked more appropriate with this rather rugged design style than much of the front nine, which I think looked better before with more lush, green grass covering the course from edge to edge. Parts of the back nine, including the new 11th hole, really reminded me of Bandon Trails and I liked that. After the renovation, they did really jack up the rates at Poppy Hills. It used to be somewhat reasonably priced in comparison to the resort courses, but now it will cost out-of-towners a pretty penny to tee it up here. NCGA members do get a lot of discounts and deals here, so it will draw plenty of regular local play. Poppy Hills doesn’t quite have the prestige of the Pebble Beach Resort courses, nor does it have the oceanfront views, so I don’t know if the new pricing will work against them when trying to attract destination golfers on their dream Pebble Beach trips. They seem to be doing just fine with it, though, so I don’t imagine the prices will come back down any time soon. Maybe they’ll reintroduce an intermediate SCGA member discount like they once had, so at least all Californians can take advantage. Either way, I think Poppy Hills is still an awesome course on every level. Personally, I would probably say I liked it better before the renovation, but I may be in the minority. Anyone who comes out and plays the new version of the course will likely not be disappointed. The natural beauty is still inspiring. The layout is very difficult, yet enjoyable. The great feeling you get when walking the inspiring landscape of Pebble Beach will never get old."
64,Poppy Hills Golf Course,non100,"Pebble Beach, CA",Robert Trent Jones Jr.,1986,Poppy Hills,Bill Satterfield,rev064_poppy_hills_2,"The Takeaway:  Poppy Hills is vastly improved since the renovation with firm and fast conditions, no rough, and great putting contours on bentgrass greens. The course feels more natural than before and while it will never compete with Pebble Beach's incredible coastal setting, Poppy Hills' successful renovation makes it pleasure to play and a great value for NCGA members.  Grade B. What to Expect:  Poppy Hills represents the first course owned and operated by an amateur golf association (Northern California Golf Association) and utilizes the course as its headquarters. The course underwent an extensive renovation that improved both the layout and conditions. Formerly nicknamed ""Sloppy Poppy"" by some of its critics, there is nothing sloppy about the new and improved Poppy Hills that plays firm and fast from tee to green thanks to a new drainage system, a new 5 A sandy base, and a more efficient sprinkler system. The bunkering is improved and lays more naturally on the land which is a welcome sight. The artificial mounds throughout the course have been eliminated which improves the look and drainage. Every green on the course was redone which included softening some contours and improving the areas leading up to the putting surface so that they would be receptive in the firm and fast conditions. In fact, attacking some pin positions is best done by landing off the green and then using the surrounding undulations to feed the ball towards the hole. An improvement that everyone will enjoy is the transformation to bentgrass greens which gives Poppy Hills perhaps the best putting surfaces in the famed Monterey area. The elimination of the doglegs and the rough provide a much more player friendly, and frankly more fun, layout then Poppy Hills experienced in the past. The rough around the trees that frame the holes has been replaced with pine straw which is much easier to play from and find a ball in. The nines have also been reversed from the original layout and some glimpses of the ocean are more readily available today. Members of the NCGA pay one-third of what the general public pays and even being accompanied by a NCGA member will cut your green fee in half. Members of the NCGA would be fools to not play the improved Poppy with rates under $100. The old Poppy Hills was forgettable, artificial, and a punchline but now stands as the best value on 17-mile drive. Individual Hole Analysis. Signature Hole:  18th Hole – 519 Yard Par 5 – The closing hole at Poppy provides an exciting finish and great risk/reward opportunity. At just 519 yards from the tips, this par five will be reachable for many players with a well struck drive. The approach shot plays to a greensite fronted by a hazard that is partially waste area and partially a creek and marked with yellow stakes. The safe play calls for a ball brought in from the right side where a hill that slopes towards the green will feed balls onto the putting surface and set up a potential eagle putt. Attacking a pin in the back left of the green is the riskiest play on this hole as there is less green to work with and a longer carry over the hazard. 18th Hole at Poppy Hills Golf Course (519 Yard Par 5). Best Par 3:  6th Hole – 200 Yards – With the ocean glistening in the background beyond the trees, a beautiful stage is set for the tee shot to this Redan green. The safe line up the right side will allow for balls to feed left, so only aim towards the left half of the green if you are totally dialed into your game. With the firm greens at Poppy, utilizing the slopes and contours can be more beneficial than trying to fly the ball towards the flag. 6th Hole at Poppy Hills Golf Course (200 Yard Par 3). Best Par 4:  14th Hole – 439 Yards – The beautiful 14th hole had some trees thinned out to expose the ocean straight ahead on this dogleg left. A draw that wraps around the tree framing the left side of the hole with quickly shorten the distance and set up a great angle for the approach shot. With bunkers on the far side of the fairway there is nothing wrong with banging a 3-wood down the middle and taking a little longer approach shot but ensuring it is done from the fairway. 14th Hole at Poppy Hills Golf Course (439 Yard Par 4). Best Par 5:  1st Hole – 514 Yards – The former 10th hole is now the opener at Poppy and it is a dandy. A huge slope frames the right side of the hole and will generously kick your slice back towards the middle of the fairway. The approach shot plays downhill to a raised green that is protected on the left side by a pond and in the center by a bunker. The sloping edges off the green present a quick introduction to the benefits of learning to bump and run the ball rather than fly it to your final destination. With a generous fairway and relatively short distance, Poppy wants you to start things off with an easy par or even a bird. 1st Hole at Poppy Hills Golf Course (514 Yard Par 5). Birdie Time:  9th Hole – 503 Yard Par 5 – At just over 500 yards this par five presents a great opportunity to reach in two. The bold play challenges the bunker on the left with a power draw that quickly shortens the hole and probably places a long or mid iron in your hands for attacking the green with. The long green presents a variety of pin placements that varies the difficulty of the hole yielding one putt eagles as quickly as three putt bogeys. 9th Hole at Poppy Hills Golf Course (503 Yard Par 5)
Bogey Beware:  7th Hole – 430 Yard Par 4 – While not punishing in length, the steady uphill nature of this hole makes it play deceptively long. After maneuvering around the bend on the right, the approach shot plays to a green fronted by a large bunker that is quick to gobble up shots that don't have the merit to carry all the way onto the putting surface. This hole plays harder than it looks and before you know it you've played a box around your score and slumped off with a bogey."
65,Galloway National Golf Club,non100,"Absecon, NJ",Tom Fazio,1995,"Galloway National Golf Club (Absecon, New Jersey)",Bill Satterfield,rev065_galloway_1,"What to Expect:  Galloway National is one of Tom Fazio’s Top 100 courses located outside of Atlantic City. The course is relatively flat and located on sandy soil in dense pine forest. Several water hazards come into play and views of the Atlantic City skyline are afforded on some of the holes. Like all Fazio courses, Galloway National features impressive bunkering, comfortable fairway widths, and fun greens. The club encourages taking a caddy and going for a walk, but carts are available as well. Individual Hole Analysis Signature Hole:  2nd Hole – 152 Yard Par 3 – With Atlantic City in the distance to the right and a marsh covering the ground between the tee box and the green, this hole visually is an impressive sight. A bunker fronts the green while a boomerang bunker flanks the left side of the hole but manages to leave a bail out area short and right. Inside the back portion of the boomerang bunker, a pine tree was planted to form a double hazard. Short and sweet at about 150 yards, this hole is an attention grabber and a great way to get things rolling early on in the round. 2nd Hole at Galloway National Golf Club (152 Yard Par 3) Best Par 3:  17th Hole – 253 Yards – Galloway National’s final par three offer one last view of Atlantic City that frames the background of the green. Plenty of room is offered short of the green on this long one-shotter that features a large bunker up the left side with a pair of trees perched in the sand. It is another impressive offering in the long list of late round par 3s that Tom Fazio has designed over the years. 17th Hole at Galloway National Golf Club (253 Yard Par 3) Best Par 4: Best Par 5:  16th Hole – 584 Yards – Fazio decided to have some fun with the par five 16th hole by shaping the fairway to look like the state of New Jersey, but the forest acts as the ocean in this reenactment while a water hazard represent Pennsylvania. A bunker climbs out of the top of the water hazard and creeps up to the front left part of the green and around a portion of the side. Visually it is a remarkable hole, and strategically it is compelling. 16th Hole at Galloway National Golf Club (584 Yard Par 5) Birdie Time:  11th Hole – 513 Yard Par 5 – Reachable par fives are great chances to card a birdie and such an opportunity is afforded at Galloway National’s 11th hole. A large bunker with a pair of fescue islands found within, engulfs the right side of the fairway about 150 yards from the green. But since this intimidating bunker is 350 yards away, it won’t come into play under most circumstances and can be avoided relatively easily when attacking this green in two. A trio of bunkers protect the green while a front the putting surface and drowns approaches hit short and left. Play to the strengths of your game and go grab a birdie! Bogey Beware:  13th Hole – 474 Yard Par 4 – This lengthy par four is plenty challenging in terms of pure yardage to cover, but factor in the 100 yard long bunker up the right side of the hole and you may have bitten off more than you can chew. Relatively straight from tee to green, there is no yardage that can be cut off on this hole. A pair of bunkers pinch the front tongue portion of the green while the back part of the green widens up considerably. In the end, this is a long hole with a ton of sand to contend with; good luck!"
66,Galloway National Golf Club,non100,"Absecon, NJ",Tom Fazio,1995,Review: Galloway National Golf Club,Worldgolfer,rev066_galloway_2,"History: Galloway National is the vision of Vernon Hill, a local multi-millionaire and founder of Commerce Bank. The official story is that Hill and his buddies were tired of slow rounds on the public Jersey Shore courses, but rumors have it Galloway was Hill’s solution for not getting into Pine Valley. With a blank check in hand, architect Tom Fazio fell in love with the waterfront property and exclaimed, “Galloway National will be one of my best courses.” soon after completing the design in 1994. Golf publications agree, and the Club holds the following accolades: Conditions: 10/10, Like most Fazio courses, Galloway National is in trememdous shape with smooth Creeping Bentgrass greens and lush rough and fairways. The bunkers (of which there are many) are also fantastic. Hole Descriptions: Architect Tom Fazio is a rather divisive figure in the architecture community. On the surface, his success is impressive, and at one point he had the most Top 100 courses of any architect. Critics, however, argue that his courses are predictable and rely on aesthetic appeal and conditioning in lieu of actual substance. After playing 140+ courses (mainly in the Northeast where Fazio is not very active), Galloway National would finally be my first Fazio. It’s hard to make a judgment after seeing just one course (especially one of his best), but I was extremely impressed by Galloway National. The course is in perfect condition and is extremely beautiful sitting directly on Reeds Bay with the Atlantic City skyline featured prominently on many holes. There are numerous sandy wastebunkers that give a Pine Valley feel and the pine tree-lined back 9 reminds me a lot of the Pinehurst area courses. I understand the criticism and doubt Fazio will ever create a course novel enough to crack the top 20, but his recipe is certainly good enough to produce many top 200 courses. I look forward to playing more of his courses in the near future. The opening hole is one of my favorites of a very strong set of par fours. At 375 yards, this sleek dogleg right features an immediate forced carry of 150 yards over wasteland to a fairway that turns right at about 230 yards. A bunker lines the left at 240 yards, while those that attempt to cut the corner will have to carry a giant wastebunker that runs from 200 yards all the way to the green. This green is narrow, slopes back-to-front with two tiers, and is guarded by deep bunkers short on either side. I’ve been told this hole pays homage to another great 1st hole in New Jersey, but I haven’t had the pleasure of making that comparison firsthand… Options abound on the opening teeshot at Galloway National The approach at the 1st plays directly towards the water. A memorable green complex caps off a fantastic starting hole. After just one dogleg, you’re already on the marshes and the 2nd hole takes full advantage as an 151 yard all-carry par 3. The carry is exhilarating but the most interesting aspect of this hole is the green, which is giant and plays as a Biarritz with a middle swoon and severely back-to-front sloped back portion. Missing this green in any direction is absolutely devastating with a bunker short, marshes right and long, and a steep embankment left that leaves a brutal up-and-down. This is just one of several world-class one-shotters at Galloway National. The memorable par 3 2nd.Don’t let the spectacular views distract you from this dangerous green If there’s a weakness of Galloway, it’s that there isn’t a great short par 4. At 345 yards, the 3rd hole is the shortest par 4 but is probably the most forgettable hole on the course. Playing straightaway and slightly uphill, this tree-lined par 4 isn’t truly reachable and a giant wastebunker down the left at 245 yards makes driver the wrong play. This large, undulating green slopes primarily back-to-front with a a bunker short. The par 4 3rd. The 4th hole is a stellar 437 yard dogleg left with a teeshot through a tight chute to a generous fairway. The dogleg doesn’t occur until about 240 yards here, so golfers will need some distance to avoid being blocked out on their second shot. From the teebox, it appears as if you should cut the corner over a giant wastebunker down the left, but this is actually not a smart play as the landing area is essentially nothing past this bunker. This approach plays over a valley of fairway to a large, reverse redan green complex guarded by a bunker right. The challenging par 4 4th. The approach at 4 from behind the giant wastebunker
Apparently Fazio intended to make the 5th hole a short par 4 but wasn’t able to for environmental reasons. Instead, the 5th is another par 3 that plays over marshland the entire way. While not as special as the 2nd, the views are again spectacular and appreciated here. Bunkers guard left and short of a back-to-front sloped green with a swale on the left. The beautiful par 3 5th. A closer look at the 5th green. At 531 yards, par 5 6th is the longest hole at Galloway National. This long, straightaway three-shotter is seemingly inspired by Pine Valley with a sandy wastebunker immediately in front of the teebox running 315 yards down the left. Another long crossbunker lines the left side of the lay-up area while a smaller one lines just short right of a large elevated green. If one can keep it straight, this becomes one of the easier holes on the course. The sandy par 5 6th. The par 4 7th hole is another that evokes feelings of Pine Valley at a strong 393 yards. With an immediate 170 yard forced carry over fescue, this hole features a tight fairway lined by thick forest down the right and a pond with fescue down the left. A tall tree down the left at about 275 yards forces the golfer to the right, where they’ll have to contend with a crossbunker at 275 yards. This approach is absolutely stunning to an elevated green guarded by a moat of jagged bunker short. The excellent par 4 7th.  I absolutely love the bunkering surrounding the 7th green. At 179 yards, the 8th hole is a classic par 3 over water to a wide green guarded by a bunker long right. This hole wouldn’t normally stand out on level terrain but Fazio did an excellent job and gave the green redan-like characteristics that make it memorable. The par 3 8th. The closing hole on the front 9 is my favorite par 5 on the course at a strong 515 yards. Like the 6th, this teeshot is semi-blind over a giant sandy wasteland. There’s more room to the right than it appears, but you must carry at least 200 yards to clear the bunker on this side. From the fairway, this hole bends slightly right with a patch of rough separating another portion of fairway for the final 160 yards. This slightly elevated green is reachable in theory but a small tree down the right forces the golfer to play a fade if he/she wants to reach from the right side of the fairway. Deep bunkers surround this green that slopes generously back left-to-front right. The semi-blind teeshot at 9. The 2nd shot at 9 with the modern clubhouse in the background. Galloway National has a reputation as a very difficult course, but you don’t really feel it on the front 9. The back 9, however, is a real challenge, playing over 400 yards longer with tighter fairways and more water hazards. The 421 yard 10th is indeed a challenging hole as a tight, straightaway par 4 with an immediate 130 yard forced carry over water. Large bunkers guard the right at 240 yards and 330 yards with another large bunker short left of the green. The most interesting aspect of this hole is the green, which plays as a dual redan with most balls funneling towards the center. The long par 4 10th. At 508 yards, the 11th hole is the shortest par 5 at Galloway National and one that gives the golfer plenty of options. The teeshot, however, is rather straightforward to a straightaway fairway lined by thick forests on both sides and a long waste bunker down the left for the first 220 yards. At 310 yards, the fairway narrows to almost nothing with giant bunkers on both sides. On the second shot, the golfer has the option of going for the shallow green, which juts out over water on the left or hitting it right to a severely right-to-left sloping fairway with an interesting knob of rough in the middle. This back-to-front sloped green is surrounded by trouble with water and a false front short and bunkers surrounding the other three sides. The par 5 11th. Do you go for glory on 11 or play it safely down the right? The 12th hole is by far the shortest par 4 on the back 9 at 363 yards, but doesn’t necessarily play easy with a tight fairway and sharp dogleg left at 250 yards. Longer hitters who can hook the ball can theoretically cut the corner, but trees down the left the entire way and a bunker at the inside corner of the dogleg make this a risky endeavor. This approach plays slightly uphill to a redan green guarded by bunkers short and left. The dogleg left 12th. The approach at 12. At 453 yards, the 13th hole is the longest par 4 on the course and a deserving number 1 handicap. This uphill, straightaway hole is intimidating off the tee with a chute of thick forests to traverse and a tight fairway lined by a giant and beautiful bunker right. This approach plays at least one club extra to a large, severely back-to-front sloped green guarded by bunkers on either side. A par here gains a shot on the field. The beastly par 4 13th. The 14th hole is the first of two excellent long par threes on the back at 203 yards. This gorgeous hole plays slightly downhill over a giant wastebunker that runs through the right side of the green. The green here is very large and slopes hard left-to-right with multiple plateaus. The par 3 14th. The 15th hole is one of my favorite holes at Galloway and marks the beginning of a fantastic final stretch. At 409 yards, this strong par 4 features an immediate 135 yard carry over water and fescue to a tight tree-lined fairway. This hole is most notable for its Hell’s half acre-inspired bunker at 285 yards that occludes much of the fairway. From here, the hole turns slightly left to a redan green lined by a deep left bunker. The strong par 4 15th. Fazio’s bunkering at 15 is absolute golf porn. The par fives at Galloway National are generally scoreable, but the 525 yard 16th hole is the most difficult of the group. This hole has been described as gimmicky by many due to its fairway shaped like New Jersey, but thankfully New Jersey has a somewhat indistinct shape and you wouldn’t necessarily know unless told. The teeshot here is quite intimidating with a long forced carry over a wastebunker, water down the left starting at 215 yards, and thick forest lining the right the entire way. This lay-up is fairly challenging as well as the fairway snakes left with trees jutting into the right and a snake-like bunker down the left. After what seems like a marathon, an undulating, elevated green awaits guarded by deep bunkers short and left. If the water hazard is “Pennsylvania” and the right trees are the “Atlantic Ocean,” then my poor drive landed somewhere near Atlantic City
The 17th hole is somewhat of a signature hole for Galloway National and is probably the most visually appealing hole on a course full of beauty. At 231 yards, this is a beast of a par 3 that plays slightly easier due to the fact that it plays downhill with ample bailout room short. This teeshot must traverse numerous wastebunkers to reach a large back-to-front sloped green. The Atlantic City skyline is seen prominently through a window of trees behind this green. The signature par 3 17th. With Atlantic City and the Bay at your back, the closing hole is fittingly epic as a 428 dogleg right. This teeshot demands an immediate 160 yard carry over marshland to reach a wide fairway that slides hard right at 250 yards. Giant bunkers line both sides of the fairway for much of the landing zone and the approach must also carry a giant wastebunker. This large, undulating green is partially hidden behind the wastebunker and is lined by another bunker right. The closing teeshot. The approach at 18. General Comments: Galloway’s practice facilities are extremely strong with a giant grass range and short game area near the 1st tee. The clubhouse is large and spacious, but is a bit too modern for my liking. There were only a few groups on the course the day I played and I got the impression the course is never too busy. Like nearby Seaview, Galloway has a real problem with green-headed flies so make sure to wear longer clothes. Galloway’s gorgeous driving range. Verdict: Beautiful, difficult, and in immaculate condition, the underrated Galloway National is an example of Tom Fazio at his absolute best. Fazio marries sandy wastebunkers, tall pines, and the Atlantic City skyline to create numerous fantastic holes and the look and feel of places like Pine Valley and Pinehurst. This is the best course in the loaded Atlantic City area and one of the best in the golf-rich state of New Jersey."
67,Dunes Golf and Beach Club,non100,"Myrtle Beach, SC",Robert Trent Jones Sr.,1948,Dunes Golf & Beach Club,top100golfcourses,rev067_dunes_golf_beach_1,"The Myrtle Beach area, known as the “Grand Strand”, is a 70-mile coastal strip of golfing and vacation heaven stretching from Pawleys Island in the south to Brunswick County in the north. Boasting more than 100 golf courses of many styles and price ranges, it is a difficult task to choose the top course on the Strand. However, since its opening in 1948 when the Robert Trent Jones Snr layout was only the second course on the Strand, the Dunes Golf & Beach Club has been at or near the top of every Myrtle Beach golf course list. The Dunes has hosted the Ladies US Open (in 1962) and the PGA Tour “Q-school.” Although located barely more than a block from the beach and with most holes subject to strong ocean breezes, the style of the course is not seaside or links by any stretch of the imagination. It has woodland, parkland and marshland elements, with the 9th being the only hole where a player catches a glimpse of the Atlantic. Most holes are lined with beautiful old oaks and water comes into play by way of ponds and marshes on more than half the holes. The mostly elevated green complexes are extremely challenging as a result of large and deep Augusta white sand bunkers. Other RTJ trademarks are the runway tee boxes and a generous dose of strategic fairway bunkering, requiring well placed tee shots. Typical of the Jones design philosophy, for the good golfer there are risk-reward options on most holes that can mean easy par if you choose the safer option and difficult birdie – with a risk of much worse – if you choose the riskier option (or for the high handicapper, easy bogey/difficult par.) The 13th hole, known as Waterloo, is a 590-yard par five in a crescent moon shape along the perimeter of Lake Singleton. A slice or push off the tee (for a right handed golfer) is wet. Any thought of going for the green in two requires a very long tee shot. However, the longer the tee shot, the narrower the fairway becomes. On the other hand, the more conservative the tee shot, the longer the remaining shots will be. Even with a moderately good tee shot, the player is then challenged to cut off as much of the lake as he dares. Bite off more than you can chew and you’re wet. Meet the challenge and a possible birdie awaits. The course has four outstanding par threes, among them the 12th hole which is all carry over a salt-water marsh. The finishing hole is a beautiful long par four with a green fronted by a pond. On either of these holes a front pin position makes firing at the flag a particularly risky choice. Since early in the new millennium the club has had Rees Jones and his associate Steve Weisser working alongside long-term superintendent Steve Hamilton on course improvements. Greens have been brought back to their original size, new tees introduced and a state-of-the-art irrigation system installed. Bunkers have also been reviewed, with Better Billy Bunker liner installed throughout. “Every bunker has been rethought and relocated or rebuilt,” said Rees Jones. “We also carefully evaluated the depths of the bunkers. We’ve taken some fill away and cut them down into the surface.” The public may play the Dunes only if booked into a limited number of Myrtle Beach accommodations, so plan your trip accordingly. While there you must also play Caledonia Golf & Fish Club located about a 30-minute drive to the South. Figuring out which of the remaining 100 or so courses to play after that will be a fun challenge."
68,Dunes Golf and Beach Club,non100,"Myrtle Beach, SC",Robert Trent Jones Sr.,1948,"Dunes Golf And Beach Club (Myrtle Beach, South Carolina)",Bill Satterfield,rev068_dunes_golf_beach_2,"The Takeaway:  The Dunes Golf and Beach Club makes a strong argument as the best course in Myrtle Beach. The conditioning is excellent and the parkland setting just feels different than many of the upper end courses in the area. While it would have been nice to have more ocean views from the course, the 19th hole provides a front row seat to the Atlantic. The course design is varied and there is little to not like about Dunes.  Grade B+. What to Expect:  The Dunes Golf and Beach Club is often referenced as the finest course in Myrtle Beach which is an impressive designation considering the 100+ courses to contend with. The clubhouse boasts a seaside location with impressive views of the ocean waves crashing into the shore. The conditions are quite plush and the course has more of a parkland feel than the dunes/links feel that I was expecting. There are gentle contours found throughout the course and several water hazards. In fact, as we approached the signature hole, I was a bit taken back by the “Beware of Alligators” sign that prominently sits next to the tee box; something you would never see back home in Idaho! Overall, the course was a pure joy to play with solid golf holes from start to finish and one of the best locations to enjoy the 19th hole. Individual Hole Analysis
Signature Hole:  13th Hole – 590 Yard Par 5 – Not only the signature hole of the course, but perhaps the signature hole of Myrtle Beach, this famous par five is as difficult as it is memorable. This dogleg right bends around Singleton Lake with the water jetting out and tightening the fairway at various places, none tighter than where the hole takes its sharpest turn right. The approach shot plays uphill to a well bunkered green which makes reaching the green in two an unlikely proposition. With alligators looming in the lake as a reminder of all of the trouble on this hole, the 13th is perhaps the finest three-shorter in South Carolina. 13th Hole at Dunes Golf and Beach Club (590 Yard Par 5). Best Par 3:  9th Hole – 200 Yards – This postcard par three boasts palm trees sprinkled across the landscape and waves from the Atlantic Ocean rolling into the beach in the background. The elevated green combined with the prevailing wind in your face make hitting this green in regulation no easy task. Factor in some white sand bunkers and this hole is as much beauty as it is beast. 9th Hole at Dunes Golf and Beach Club (200 Yard Par 3). Best Par 4:  11th Hole – 430 Yards – The 11th hole plays along the marsh known as Singleton Swash and should have golfers thinking about hitting it anywhere except right. Trees provide a buffer between the fairway and the marsh prior to the fairway turning 90 degrees to the right and the green being fronted by water. The hole is long enough and the approach shot demanding enough that it is tough to justify playing too safely off the tee, but this hole certainly rewards accuracy more than length. 11th Hole at Dunes Golf and Beach Club (430 Yard Par 4).  Best Par 5:  13th Hole – 590 Yards – Already featured as the signature hole, this larger than life par five is well known up and down the Grand Strand. With a ""Beware of Alligators"" sign causing players to be nervous in the first place, the hole doesn't hold back as this lengthy three-shotter banks right around Singleton Lake and uphill to an undulated green protected by bunkers and sitting in an amphitheater of trees. This green sits at the northeast corner of the property with attractive views across the lake and of the coastal buildings. The wind also tends to be stronger moving across the lake which can affect approach shots here. 13th Hole at Dunes Golf and Beach Club (590 Yard Par 5). Birdie Time:  4th Hole – 505 Yard Par 5 – A very reachable par five greets you at the 4th hole which is a dogleg left protected on the corner by a pair of bunkers. The green is fronted by a thin creek which acts as the main defense to this vulnerable hole. If you can reach the green in two with an iron in your hand then take a rip and two putt your way to glory. If you need to lay up, you still have a great chance to convert a birdie since there is plenty of room to hit to your favorite yardage. The 4th is a great chance to get under par early in the round. 4th Hole at Dunes Golf and Beach Club (505 Yard Par 5). Bogey Beware:  12th Hole – 245 Yard Par 3 – Playing along Singleton Swash, this lengthy par three is intimidating to attack. If the wind is coming off the ocean and across the lake then players may have to consider starting their ball over the hazard in hopes that it blows back to the green. It may not be sexy, but you may want to implore Billy Casper's 1959 U.S. Open strategy where he laid up on the lengthy 3rd everyday and took par all four rounds. 12th Hole at Dunes Golf and Beach Club (245 Yard Par 3).

69,Hyannisport Club,non100,"Hyannis Port, MA","Alex Findlay, 1897/Donald Ross, 1936",1897,Hyannisport Club,John Sabino,rev069_hyannisport_1,"I am finally catching up on old posts from rounds played this past summer and highlight a low-key club that remains a prized invitation in the world of golf. The Hyannisport Club was established in 1897 in Hyannisport, Mass on Cape Cod. Hyannisport Club is not ranked in the top 100, but then again neither are many other fantastic golf clubs like Whippoorwill, Myopia Hunt Club and Piping Rock. The club is located within walking distance of the Kennedy compound in Hyannis and JFK used to play here when he was on the cape. The course has world class views of the water and the surrounding tidal marshes looking out into Nantucket Sound. The course itself was designed by Alex Findlay in 1901. Findlay was born to Scottish parents while on board a ship coming in America in 1865. It was re-designed by Donald Ross in 1936 and plays from a yardage of 6,348 yard from the tips. The course has a set of small, very fast greens. Many of the greens are quite narrow as well with bunkers on long side of the greens. More than once I found myself in a bunker and if you don't hit the perfect high shot you will find yourself in a bunker on the other side of the green. The course begins with a relatively straight 448 yard par four, a gentle opener. This is followed by a 265 yard par four that is also relatively easy. The third features a dogleg left that plays at an angle off the tee to a fairway set over a tidal marsh. The fourth is a 410 yard dogleg  that plays around the same body of water. The par threes on the course all feature a landing pad in front of the greens that at first slopes away from your line of play and then slopes upward. This makes the approach shots to the green very tricky because if you land your shot just a bit short and it hits on the downslope then it will likely shoot across the green. Factor in the wind and it becomes even trickier. Particularly good par threes include the 195-yard eighth, which plays into a cross-wind coming off the Sound. The fifteenth, a 177-yarder and the seventeenth, a 141-yarder play directly into the prevailing wind. All three are good golf holes. Another hole of note is the 476-yard par five sixteenth which plays through a dramatic left to right sloping hill. Your tee shot is blind as is your second over the hill. Although you will likely have a very short iron into the green, it is also highly likely that you will have a uneven lie as the terrain slopes on the entire hole from left to right. The holes along the water and marsh reminded me quite a bit of Maidstone in East Hampton, and many of the approach shots play the same way they do on the holes that border the pond at Maidstone. Aside from a couple of holes on the front that play over marshes the course has no water hazards. John Kennedy followed Eisenhower as president and the latter played over 1,000 rounds while he was President. Camelot was sensitive to this fact and positioned himself as a contrast of the old guard Republicans who played golf all the time. Thus, he would normally play with little fanfare and would sneak out without the media present. He would often play a short loop of holes at Hyannisport, the first and second followed by sixteen through eighteen, all of which are near the clubhouse. The finishing hole looks easy on the scorecard at 310 yards but it plays straight up a big hill and features a narrow tee shot. A view from above the eighteenth green overlooking Nantucket Sound and the marshes is below. One of the things that is so unique and pleasurable about golf is to be able to play where your idols have played before you. What a thrill to walk and play where JFK used to. "
70,Hyannisport Club,non100,"Hyannis Port, MA","Alex Findlay, 1897/Donald Ross, 1936",1897,Review: Hyannisport Club,Worldgolfer,rev070_hyannisport_2,"History: Hyannisport’s architectural history is a bit murky but begins in 1897 when founding member John Reid laid out a 6-hole layout for his friends. In 1902, the Club hired prolific architect Alex Findlay to build an additional 3 holes to make it a 9-hole course. Today’s 1st, 2nd, 15th, 16th, and 18th are practically conserved from this primitive course. It’s unclear when Hyannisport expanded to 18 holes, but it certainly was 18 holes after Donald Ross redesigned it in 1936. Today’s course is Ross’ with a few upgrades from Ron Forse along the way. Never in the national spotlight and immensely private, Hyannisport hosted the Massachusetts Open in 1958 and 1959 but seems unlikely to do so in the future at its short length. The Club is perhaps most famous for being home to John F. Kennedy and the Kennedy Compound is just a few hundred yards from the course. Hyannisport has earned the following awards: Conditions: 9/10, Hyannisport is in excellent condition with lush fairways, thick rough, and well-kept bunkers and teeboxes. Similar to many seaside courses, the greens here aren’t blazingly fast, but certainly roll true. Hole Descriptions: When it comes to golf on the Cape, there’s Eastward Ho! and Hyannisport and then everything else. At the time of writing this, I actually haven’t explored the Cape as much as I should’ve but I’ve been fortunate to play both Eastward and Hyannisport and it’s hard not to compare the two. Both are short, historic, seaside courses with fantastic views and an emphasis on fun when the wind isn’t howling. With that being said, I much prefer Eastward Ho! to Hyannisport for several reasons. First and foremost, the quality and depth of holes is much stronger at Eastward. While there are one, maybe two, weaker holes at the Ho!, Hyannisport features several world-class holes mainly on the water and a rather forgettable interior. The 3rd, 4th, 8th, and 16th are fantastic, but many of the other holes are simply tree-lined and straight, running parallel to each other. Donald Ross is a master router, but Hyannisport was not his best effort, perhaps because he inherited the canvas of several other architects. Hyannisport does have its merits, however. The aforementioned holes are tremendous and walking where JFK played so many rounds is a special feeling. Hyannisport is not a long course at just over 6400 yards from the Black Tees, but the opening hole is an anomaly as a 439 yard par 4. Playing straightaway downhill, the longest par 4 on the course features a generous and undulating fairway lined by rough and small trees. There are several bunkers on either side for the final 100 yards, but I’m not sure what these are protecting. This green is excellent and one of the best on the course running back-to-front with multiple tiers and deep bunkers on either side. The approach into the excellent 1st green. At just 280 yards, the 2nd hole is the shortest par 4 at Hyannisport and a rather easy hole. Although the fairway progressively narrows with numerous bunkers as you near this narrow green, it’s not enough to salvage this fairly mundane straightaway, flat hole. Apparently Ross thought the same and desired the green to be built into a hill long left, but his vision never came to fruition. A closer look at the danger surrounding the 2nd green. The next two holes are some of the finest on the course as long Cape par fours. The 3rd hole is the better of the two and my favorite hole at Hyannisport (and one of my favorite par fours anywhere)! At 395 yards, this is a hole that simply cannot be replicated with today’s modern restrictions on environmental areas. Beginning with an exhilarating teeshot over the marshes, the golfer must choose how much to bite off with a carry ranging from 100 to 210 yards depending on how far left you venture. This slab of fairway ends abruptly with more hazards about 100 yards short of the green, requiring yet another carry to find this square, rather receptive green lined by a bunker right and marshes long and left. The 4th hole is another stunner as a 410 yard dogleg left par 4. The number 1 handicap, this difficult hole features a somewhat confusing teeshot with ample room to the right that’s further from the hole. Marshland hugs the entire lefthand corner of the fairway and the golfer needs at least a 210 yard carry to have a reasonable approach. This right-to-left sloping green juts out into the marsh with a trio of bunkers guarding right and marsh long and left. A par here is well-earned. The 5th hole brings us to the first par 3 at Hyannisport at 176 yards. This was originally a par 4 from the current 4th teebox on Findlay’s 1902 course so the green is set at an awkward angle from its current teebox. Diagonal with an opening short right, this green slopes hard back-to-front with two tiers and is surrounded by four deep bunkers at its corners.  A closer look at the wicked slope at 5 The 6th hole is the first of two rather pedestrian and similar par fives on the front 9. At 520 yards, this straightaway hole initially plays uphill over a plateau with a semi-blind teeshot. Trees run down the left side the entire way while the right is more open besides a trio of bunkers between 160 and 240 yards. This lay-up is complicated by bunkers on either side and a narrowing fairway. A large, receptive green is defended by bunkers left, long, and right. The par 5 6th Be careful to avoid the numerous bunkers at 6 At 414 yards, the 7th hole runs parallel to the 6th back towards the water. This beautiful, straightaway hole plays downhill with a generous fairway lined by trees and bunkers on either side between 200 and 230 yards. The approach here is stellar with a rumpled fairway and a beautiful water backdrop. This circular green is well-defended by two bunkers right, one left, and marshland long. The beautiful par 4 7th The approach at 7 The longest and most difficult par 3 at 202 yards, the 8th hole is also my favorite of a very nice set of one-shotters at Hyannisport. Lying directly on the water on the furthest west part of the property, this flat hole is quite intimidating with an immediate 120 yard forced carry over marshland. While there’s ample fairway short of the green, this putting surface is quite small for the distance and difficult to hit with a long club and lots of wind. A trio of bunkers is built into a hill behind the green and tight fairway lies surround the rest of the green. This is a first-rate golf hole. The terrific par 3 8th At 540 yards, the 9th hole is the longest hole at Hyannisport as a lengthy, narrow par 5. From the Black tees, this is easily the most intimidating teeshot on the course with OB lining the entire left side, trees down the right, and a semi-blind plateau to carry. Once you find the fairway, this hole is fairly straightforward with alternating crossbunkers on either side for the final 120 yards and a back-to-front sloped green defended by bunkers on either side. Both accuracy and length are required at the 9th The approach at 9 The 10th hole is an excellent one, but whose similarity to the 7th just a few holes before slightly weakens its effect. Running downhill at 410 yards, this straightaway par 4 features a semi-blind, treelined teeshot to a fairway that slopes hard right-to-left. Long hitters need to be aware of a right crossbunker at 290 yards, but otherwise there is little danger here. This approach plays to an elevated green defended by a bunker left. The par 4 10th The gorgeous approach at 10
At 424 yards uphill, the par 4 11th hole is a difficult slight dogleg right. Featuring a blind teeshot over a plateau, this hole is tree-lined with no bunkers until the final 80 yards. A crossbunker lines the right side of the fairway about 80 yards short and this undulating green is well-defended by three bunkers on either side. The semi-blind par 4 11th The approach at 11
The 12th hole continues a stretch of longer par fours at 415 yards. A sharp dogleg right, this tree-lined hole features a generous fairway that turns at about 230 yards with two bunkers on the inside of the dogleg. From here, this hole is relatively straightforward with a large Redan-like green surrounded only by rough. Leaf rule seems to be in full effect at the 12th The approach at 12 Like the 2nd, the 13th and 14th are consecutive straightaway par fours that fail to leave a lasting memory after playing the course once. At 318 yards, the 13th is a simple hole with a generous, flat fairway devoid of danger besides a bunker down the left at 240 yards. Although you’ll likely only have wedge in, this is one of the better approaches at Hyannisport with a small, back-to-front sloped green guarded by bunkers on either side and a tree short right.


The straightaway par 4 13th

The pretty approach at 13
At 380 yards, the 14th is slightly longer, but also plays flat and straightaway. The fairway is also wide here but narrows around 240 yards with bunkers on both sides. This green is large and lined by bunkers on either side.


The level par 4 14th
Originally the 7th hole on the 1902 course, today’s 15th is a beautiful hole that marks a return to the seaside holes. At 185 yards, this one-shotter runs downhill to a large, back-to-front sloped green lined by deep bunkers on either side. The view behind this green is tremendous and makes you excited for the closing stretch.


The par 3 15th
At just 482 yards, the wonderfully quirky 16th hole is by far the best and most memorable par 5 at Hyannisport. This is an absolutely wild dogleg right where the green is only about 380 yards from the teebox and visible jutting out over the right marshes. This hole plays straightaway for the first 290 yards or so and features a tighter fairway highlighted by a giant uphill slope and plateau at about 250 yards. Just like the notorious closer at Yale, those who don’t reach this plateau may be left a completely blind second shot and not enough room to get the ball high enough quickly. After this plateau, the hole darts to the right downhill with the range down the left and marshland right. This green is open up front and certainly reachable in two but six bunkers surround it long and on both sides. This approach is one of the most beautiful at Hyannisport and this is one of the most unique risk/reward short par fives I’ve played.


The par 5 16th

The all-world approach at 16
The 17th hole is the shortest on the course at just 143 yards, but sits on one of the windiest parts of the property along the marshes. Featuring perhaps the most severe back-to-front slope at Hyannisport, this green is also quite narrow and defended by deep bunkers on either side. A par here demands a controlled ballflight and deft putting touch.


The short par 3 17th
At 310 yards, the closing par 4 plays much longer straight uphill towards the clubhouse. It doesn’t seem like this hole has changed much since 1902 with the range down the left and OB to the far right. Bunkers begin at 270 yards with one down the right and four gorgeous bunkers guard this elevated green long, left, and right. This green also runs extremely hard back-to-front with a false front short.


The closer plays longer than the scorecard

The 18th green is well-defended and difficult

A look from behind the 18th
General Comments: Hyannisport’s unassuming yet charming clubhouse and practice facilities occupy some of the best land on the property sitting on the highest point overlooking Centerville Harbor. It’s hard to imagine a better spot for a clam chowder and cocktail after a round. Practice facilities include a small practice green and short range between the 16th and 18th holes. Like most Cape courses, Hyannisport is mainly a summer retreat and not nearly as busy in the off-season.


The incredible view from the clubhouse

Hyannisport’s driving range
Verdict: Although not quite the best course on the Cape, the exclusive seaside home of The Kennedy Family offers ample fun, several world-class holes, and spectacular views. Hyannisport is absolutely worth the play if you get an invite."
71,Farmlinks,non100,"Sylacauga, AL",Michael Hurdzan/Dana Fry,2003,"Farmlinks At Pursell Farms (Sylacauga, Alabama)",Jason Seymour,rev071_farmlinks_1,"The Takeaway:  Pursell Farms is a golf course located in Talladega County, Alabama. Located on the other side of the county from the famed racetrack—is an exceptional golf course located in very rural Alabama. Designed by the Hurdzan-Fry Environmental Golf Design, Inc team, the course is a very friendly and playable experience. It is a high end public high daily fee course that offers stay and play packages. The course is very well maintained and should be played by anyone visiting Alabama to play the RTJ Trail.  Grade A-
What to Expect:  I would like to share with you, my experience. I had taken a trip to Alabama with my graduating senior son for a golf trip on the RTJ Trail. Like most high school seniors, he is on social media. Somehow, someway—and I can't tell you the particulars, my son in Utah was aware of Pursell Farms. Our flight was later that day and we decided to take the drive and visit Pursell Farms prior to our flight. I am so glad we did. The rural roads that lead into Pursell Farms were like a destination site. It was akin to visiting Dismal River, or Sand Hills. Very remote. You passed old Baptist churches, rolling farmland, two lane roads to the middle of nowhere...but once you got there, immediately I realized this is a special place. I can't speak of the particulars—this is what I gleaned from the workers about the place. This is a generational property and the family over time has made this a reality. The profits from the golf course help support their Christian Ministries and philanthropical pursuits. As you drive into the property, you drive for a while thru rolling farmland that offers shooting, fishing, hunting excursions until you finally come to the golf course and clubhouse. Knowing NOTHING of the property and course, I was immediately excited to play and experience Pursell Farms. I promise anyone who visits will come to the same realization that I had—if you visit the RTJ Trail in Alabama and don't visit Pursell Farms, you have done yourself a disservice. It is a truly special place—with a southern vibe that needs to be experienced. I am so grateful for my son for knowing about this property and sharing it with him.
Individual Hole Analysis
Signature Hole:  7th Hole – 425 Yard Par 4 – I know what everyone wants me to say—the hole number five. The dramatic 175-foot drop to the green. It's dramatic and everyone will photograph that hole. But for me, I have a different hole for differing reasons. What makes Pursell Farms special is all the markers they have on the course. You read about the family, what happened at the particular places on the course. It's a story. A story of a family. Take the time to read the markers and feel their presence. Life is so hectic, but Pursell Farms is an experience. For me, that story is Hole number 7, Big Daddy. A tire swing and the families homestead was there. The singular tree with the tire swing, set against the beautiful trees captured my soul. The hole was beautiful, but the poignant reminders of family were touching. That hole is the essence of Pursell Farms. As I read the marker and walked up the hill to the par three thru the trees, I just felt I was in a special place. More than a golf course. I was part of the story. And that story resonated in my heart. More than just a beautiful hole, it was the combination of all that happened in that area that made this my signature hole.

Best Par 3:  17th Hole – 193 Yards – Many people will remember Hole number five: Hang Time for pictures, etc. It will be the hole that gets your attention. But it is not the best par three on the course. It's most famous due to the dramatic drop off. But the best par three is Big Gulp, number 17 over the pond as you close out your round. Three of the four par threes play downhill and this hole, with the dramatic pond in front and the green situated next to the pond is the best par three on the course. It too is downhill, but not as much as the other two par threes. A bunker on the right side of the green needs to be avoided, but the green nestled between the pond and the beautiful hard woods trees in the back make a dramatic theatre of golf. This is the best par three on the course without a doubt.

Best Par 4:  16th Hole – 393 Yards – The closing holes at Pursell are REALLY special. In fact, Dana's Pick, hole number 16, could be one of the most beautiful holes I have ever seen. A dog leg right hole, slightly uphill to a perched green nestled on the hill side and surrounded by beautiful trees is unforgettable. From a strategic perspective, 16 has all you want and more. This is the type of hole that requires an excellent drive to set up a really good approach to a daunting green with much undulation. Everything about this hole is really good. From a design element, visualization, beauty and setting—this hole has it all. As you play Dana's Pick, you too will understand what I am saying. Words are not sufficient for how good this hole is. For me, it was the best hole on the entire course and one that I will never forget.

Best Par 5:  6th Hole – 600 Yards – Bootlegger is the best par five on the course. The sixth hole is a downhill par five, hitting from an elevated tee box. The hole is in front of you—it lays on the land like it has always been there. The views from the tee box, down the fairway are spectacular. Little land was removed to create this hole, except the trees but is a really good strong par five that requires precision to properly attack the pin and green. The fairway rises to the perched green with slopes off the left and back side of the hole. This particular hole has design elements that I enjoy. From the tee box, the hole allows you to swing away but it requires you to pick the right line—as well as your approach. Though subtle—it forces you to pay attention. A very well designed hole.

Birdie Time:  1st Hole – 576 Yard Par 5 – For clarification, my son and I made a bad decision. Being from Utah, I looked at the score card, saw 6900 yards and we played from those tee boxes. 6900 yards in Utah is way different than 6900 yards in Alabama. I didn't have many birdies (except into 18, I hit a hybrid from 215 on my third shot into 18 to about three feet for my only birdie of the day). Had we played the correct tee boxes, maybe I could give you a better suggestion—maybe the first hole out of the shoot. Hole number one, the Farm is a par five that is pretty benign in its start. A gentle par five that bends slightly to the right would be my thought. A good drive with a hint of fade and good approach will start you out with an opportunity for birdie out of the gate. I didn't make a birdie on that hole because I was in awe of the property from the get-go. A beautiful pond to the right got my attention and the landscape from the start is truly special.

Bogey Beware:  4th Hole – 476 Yard Par 4 – Lower 40, hole number four is a really difficult hole. It's significantly uphill, separated by a stream that intersects the green and the fairway. The hole is a slight dogleg to the left with the contour of the fairway sloping to the right. You need to hit a booming draw and then account for the elevated green perched on the hillside. I am not sure, but my guess is that this is the number one handicap hole on the course. Again, we played the wrong tee box for elevation, etc. But this hole, along with hole number 12, Eureka Railroad were extremely long and difficult. One more thought: Eureka Railroad, if the pin is front left and you are a back left—you can't two putt that hole. I tried! If the pin is left, aim for the right side of the green. Two months after playing the course, I have not forgotten how difficult the green was on number 12—Eureka Railroad. What a special place!"
72,Farmlinks,non100,"Sylacauga, AL",Michael Hurdzan/Dana Fry,2003,FarmLinks,top100golfcourses,rev072_farmlinks_2,"Designed by Dr Michael Hurdzan and Dana Fry, the course at FarmLinks Golf Club opened its tees for play in 2003 and has never looked back. Routed generously though part of the 3,500-acre Pursell Farms estate in Sylacauga, FarmLinks continues to garner golfing admirers and for good reasons.

The course forms the sporting focal point of a property that is part resort, part research and learning centre, where the boundaries of agronomy and agriculture are constantly being pushed by a family business that has been successfully operating in this line of business since 1904.

Feature holes include the pond-protected par fours at the 2nd and 9th and the long, downhill par threes at the 5th and 8th. On the back nine, the 616-yard 18th is a formidable closing hole, with a couple of large oak trees and three fairway bunkers blocking the most direct route to the home green.

The following edited extract by architect Michael Hurdzan is from Volume Six of Golf Architecture: A Worldwide Perspective. Reproduced with kind permission. To obtain a copy of the book, email Paul Daley at fswing@bigpond.net.au.

“At the epicentre of FarmLinks is the Pursell family, who for generations has lived on farms near Sylacauga, about fifty miles south of Birmingham. In 1904, descendants of the family formed and managed the Sylacauga Fertiliser Company that served local cotton farmers.

As each successful generation took over and managed the company, they sought to develop new technologies and markets. Over time, they developed a worldwide market for their high-tech fertiliser, Polyon, an encapsulated, slow-release fertiliser that is ideal for golf courses.

To showcase ground-breaking products, Pursell Technologies began to offer tours of its fertiliser plant. In 2001, under the leadership of then-CEO David Pursell, the firm began construction of his vision for FarmLinks golf course – the world’s first research and development golf course ‘to serve as a living laboratory’.

When FarmLinks opened in 2003, Pursell could then show clients their products in actual use on the course. So, at first, FarmLinks was intended as a way to demonstrate and market Pursell technologies products: but David saw how an even broader impact could be made by having so-called partners.

Importantly, these partners would not be competitors but rather companies that made and sold irrigation equipment, mowers and maintenance equipment, golf cars and pest control. Under this arrangement, these companies could now also test, compare and market their products on a course dedicated to Best Management Practices.

So, FarmLinks’ second incarnation was a broad-based industry showcase. Pursell Technologies sold its fertiliser business in 2008 but kept the golf course and its partners. The year 2011 marked the third life for FarmLinks: the world’s first educational program tailored for greens’ committee members and non-technical course superintendents.

Since the goal for the golf course was outreach education, small groups of superintendents and golf officials are invited to come to FarmLinks and stay for a couple of days of relaxed education. The guests stay at Parker Lodger, meals are prepared and served family-style in the large dining room, and guests relax and socialise in the great room, game room or multi-purpose room.

The program is wildly successful. Even so, David Pursell believed that the outreach was too limited; and so they re-evaluated and decided to develop a program for non-technical decision makers, such as those who chair the greens’ committees, sports turf supervisors and international guests interested in golf.

The intention is to give the students enough basic agronomy and business practice, and mix the knowledge liberally with hands-on practical exercise on the golf course. At the end, it is hoped the student understands how grass grows, the stresses caused by maintenance (and) what the superintendent has to do to counter those stresses.

FarmLinks is far more than just a fun test of golf, for it is also a living laboratory and educational outreach facility that distinguishes it as ‘first among equals’. Plans are to continue to expand the invitation list to include a wider variety of international guests from countries where golf is well-established, as well as places where golf is just starting to grow.”"
73,Ak-Chin Southern Dunes Golf Club,non100,"Maricopa, AZ",Lee Schmidt/Brian Curley,2002,"Ak-Chin Southern Dunes Golf Club (Maricopa, Arizona)",Bill Satterfield,rev073_ak-chin_southern_1,"The Takeaway:  Feeling more like a parkland course than a target desert course, Ak-Chin is one of Arizona's more enjoyable courses with a forgiving layout highlighted by sweeping greens that will test your flatstick.  Grade B+

What to Expect:  Ak-Chin Southern Dunes is located 35 miles south of Phoenix outside the famed hub of Scottsdale courses; but you'd be amiss to skip it on a visit to the desert. The Lee Schmidt and Brian Curley design certainly stands as one of the more enjoyable courses to play in Arizona since it doesn't play like target desert golf that so many courses in the area do. While it is known for its difficulty due to the overall length paired with the plethora of bunkers featuring varying depths, the fairway widths are plenty forgiving and the greensites are fair so that you don't feel like you are getting punished all round. Speaking of greensites, rather than big undulations, Southern Dunes features sweeping greens where the slope is consistent and requires a deft touch with your putter to navigate the speed and line just right. In fact, when I think of Ak-Chin Southern Dunes, I think about the greens. Players will find the setting appealing from the perspective of it having a bit more of a parkland feel with a wide variety of trees and native desert plants rather than just cacti, rocks, and sand like so many courses in the Grand Canyon State. The terrain is also pretty tame so walking the course would be relatively easy though most players elect to take a cart. One thing that stands out is the great variety of hole lengths and shapes that will consistently test your game while begging you to utilize every club in the bag; and what more can you ask for than that? In the end, Ak-Chin Southern Dunes is a really good course in the Phoenix area. It tests your game, has great variety, and will make you a better putter. If it were located in Scottsdale, it would get a lot more hype than it does now.
Individual Hole Analysis
Signature Hole:  10th Hole – 412 Yard Par 4 – The 10th is a dogleg right that runs alongside a pond before it gives way to a bunker and the fairway bends around it to the greensite. That bunker encroaches out from the right into the fairway and fronts part of the green, a green that has more sand left and right of it than it has grass to putt on. Deciding how much of the corner to cut with the tee shot is the most critical element to success here and the multiple hazards add a layer of strategy to it.
10th Hole at Ak-Chin Southern Dunes Golf Club (412 Yard Par 4)
Best Par 3:  4th Hole – 165 Yards – A very wide but shallow green, the 4th at Ak-Chin Southern Dunes will require your best distance control to come out successful. The putting surface measures 36 yards wide but only 1/3 as deep along most of the green and has bunkers in front and back to fall in if you don't execute properly. The high lip on the bunker fronting the left third of the green can impede the view for that portion of the green which sits nearest to the golfer while back right pins will be the furthest away and most challenging to hit close.
4th Hole at Ak-Chin Southern Dunes Golf Club (165 Yard Par 3)
Best Par 4:  2nd Hole – 370 Yards – A hole that essentially doglegs 90 degrees right, the short par four 2nd offers a generous landing area on the left but tries to tempt players on the right to take an aggressive line at the green. A large bunker 90 yards short of the green comes into play on the right side and continues nearly all the way to the edge of the green and would require 315 yards of carry from the back tee to cover. Laying up to the left will leave an approach to the green where the angle will give you nearly three times more depth to work with than width, effectively requiring you to hit one of your most precise shots of the day.
2nd Hole at Ak-Chin Southern Dunes Golf Club (370 Yard Par 4)
Best Par 5:  13th Hole – 606 Yards – Stretching out over 600 yards, the 13th is a sizable journey located along the western boundary of the property. The fairway bends slowly and steadily to the right the entire way to the green with desert lining both sides of the fairway. The steady uphill ascension of the design makes the hole play longer than the yardage indicates and the green sits at the base of a berm that sets the background. Players trying to reach as close to the green in two as possible will find the largest bunker on the course looming on the left side 75 yards short of the green's front edge.
13th Hole at Ak-Chin Southern Dunes Golf Club (606 Yard Par 5)
Birdie Time:  14th Hole – 323 Yard Par 4 – While it may appear that there is more sand than grass to hit with the tee shot, trust your swing and make your main goal to carry the trio of bunkers coming in from the left. There is a 50 yard deep landing zone between those bunkers and the green that is the perfect spot to hit a flip wedge from and an opportunity to get it close to the hole. The sides and back of the green are surrounded by bunkers, but the opening in the front is all grass so that you can come in high or low with your approach shot.
14th Hole at Ak-Chin Southern Dunes Golf Club (323 Yard Par 4)
Bogey Beware:  8th Hole – 484 Yard Par 4 – Named ""Hardest,"" the 8th is certainly that at Ak-Chin Southern Dunes. Playing a bit shy of 500 yards and giving you just four strokes to get in the hole, the 8th will require your best effort to avoid a bogey. The tee shot is pinched by four bunkers in the driving zone; two on each side of the fairway. From there, the angle of the fairway and bunker placement asks players to hit a draw into the green where they will then face a steadily sloping putting surface that makes gauging the speed and line perfectly an extreme challenge.

74,Ak-Chin Southern Dunes Golf Club,non100,"Maricopa, AZ",Lee Schmidt/Brian Curley,2002,Course Review(s): Ak-Chin Southern Dunes Golf Club,Bogeys Across America,rev074_ak-chin_southern_2,"After my warm-up round at The Duke at Rancho El Dorado, I headed a few miles down the road to Ak-Chin Southern Dunes Golf Club. Whereas The Duke is pretty much right in the small town of Maricopa, Ak-Chin Southern Dunes is much more isolated with no homes or signs of civilization around the course. That is easily part of the overall appeal here.

I had a 12:20 tee time and was paired with a threesome of PGA club pros. It really adds some pressure to your game when you are playing with such skilled players. They played the gold tees (6,902 yards) while I played the blues (6,493). Not even they wanted to play the black tees (7,330) or the even-further-back tips (7,546), which didn’t even have markers out on Tuesday.

Ak-Chin Southern Dunes was opened in 2002. I believe it was originally just called Southern Dunes and then was renamed Royal Dunes for a brief period under a different owner. Then the Ak-Chin Reservation took over the course and hence the current name. The course was designed by Schmidt-Curley with the assistance of Fred Couples. Their goal was to have more of a Scottish links-inspired layout rather than a typical “desert” course.

It’s hard to not feel like a desert course when you are smack dab in the middle of the desert, but you can definitely sense the links concept here with rolling terrain and ample bunkering.

Really the story of Ak-Chin Southern Dunes is the abundance of sand. You can’t escape it. Every shot is affected by the threat of menacing bunkers and desert waste areas. There is only one water hazard on the course that comes into play on holes 10 and 18. Otherwise, it’s all about the bunkering. There are so many bunkers. Some are massive. Some are small. All are best avoided if you want to post a decent score. The bunkers cut across fairways and shape the doglegs. They effectively guard the greens and provide visual intimidation on each approach shot. They also create optical illusions at times, meaning what looks like a greenside bunker from the fairway may actually be 50 yards short of the green surface.

I truly can’t think of another course I’ve played where the bunkers have this much impact on strategy. Ak-Chin Southern Dunes is a course that demands careful thinking and proper execution.

I should note there is always ample bail-out room on your tee shots. The bunkers usually just help you determine how aggressive you want to be with your lines. As you get closer to any given green, however, the sand traps will come more and more into play.

If you are able to avoid the bunkers, you will still have some rather tricky greens to deal with. The green complexes at Ak-Chin Southern Dunes come in some funky shapes and don’t always offer a lot of room to work with on approach shots. Add in some false edges and undulations, and you get another major element of challenge on this course.

And, I haven’t even mentioned the wind yet. The wind was very inconsistent during our round. Sometimes it was blowing hard and other times it was dead calm. However, given the location and the isolation of this course, I can imagine it gets really, really windy here on certain days.

One thing I liked about Ak-Chin Southern Dunes on a personal level is that this course definitely favors a left-to-right ball flight as most doglegs turn to the right. However, with no big trees in play, you can effectively work your way around this course with any type of shot shape.

I’m not sure what is considered the signature hole here. A lot of the course does blend together a bit. The 18th definitely sticks out as unique because of the water hazard guarding the green.

I do wish there was more of a signature par-3 on this course. All the par-3s are nice and demanding in their own ways, but I wasn’t particularly blown away by any one of them. I’d probably pick the 4th as my favorite of the bunch with the most intricate bunkering guarding the front of the green.

The conditions here were excellent overall. The tee boxes were nice. The fairways were great. The ground underneath was firm, so that offered nice roll-out. However, the grass on top was always fluffy enough to provide good lies. The overseeded rough was also nice throughout, though there are quite a few burrowing animal holes that are unfortunate to see. The bunkers generally had good sand. I think they could use some reappropriation of the sand, though. In general, they seemed to be on the firm/thin side at the bottom and super soft around the edges (I had one ball plug under the lip), which is the opposite of how it should be if you ask me. The greens were super firm and pretty quick. Not even the PGA pros could get balls to stop on some of these greens with wedges in hand!

The greater Phoenix/Scottsdale area is obviously loaded with exceptional golf and Ak-Chin Southern Dunes is another to put in the upper tier of public-accessible courses. It’s definitely a must-play if you are looking south of the city."
75,Fossil Trace Golf Club,non100,"Golden, CO",Jim Engh,2003,"Fossil Trace Golf Club (Golden, Colorado)",Bill Satterfield,rev075_fossil_trace_1,"What to Expect:  Fossil Trace is an excellent public access facility named for the dinosaur fossils found in the area. Jim Engh spent several years on the project working through a variety of challenges but finally came up with a great course that is different from your typical muni. Be prepared to face a hole with an incinerator in the fairway, another with boulders in the fairway, and plenty of wild greens and bunkers to contend with.
Individual Hole Analysis
Signature Hole:  12th Hole – 585 Yard Par 5 – Jim Engh has a flare for the dramatic and Fossil Trace's signature hole shows why. How many golf holes have you played that feature three large boulders resting in the fairway? I've only played one and it is this exciting par five that also boasts a pair of deep ""muscle"" bunkers.
12th Hole at Fossil Trace Golf Club (585 Yard Par 5)
Best Par 3:  16th Hole – 160 Yards – Jim Engh loves to tuck greens behind water hazards and the 16th hole fits right in with that scheme. The green sits in a bowl which makes going long safe but shots hit short will either find the expansive bunker or will find the drink.
16th Hole at Fossil Trace Golf Club (160 Yard Par 3)
Best Par 4:  13th Hole – 394 Yards – This par four requires some strategy to succeed at scoring well. First, don't pull out your driver because missing the fairway is death. Second, know the pin placement to optimize your approach shot strategy. Third, a two-putt anywhere on this green is an accomplishment.
13th Hole at Fossil Trace Golf Club (394 Yard Par 4)
Best Par 5:  12th Hole – 585 Yards – This signature par five features OB right of the cart path so the logical play is up the safer left side. However, reaching the green in two from the left side means playing a draw through the boulders and over the muscle bunker fronting this shallow green. Good luck!
12th Hole at Fossil Trace Golf Club (585 Yard Par 5)
Birdie Time:  2nd Hole – 320 Yard Par 4 – While some might argue that the 96 yard 5th hole is a great birdie opportunity, I think more players will find a way to get under par on the 320 yard 2nd hole. The design allows for drives to chase up on the green for an eagle putt while the green sits 25 feet below the fairway in a bowl that is almost impossible to miss with a short approach shot. Knock it stiff and go one under.

Bogey Beware:  9th Hole – 659 Yard Par 5 – Measuring 659 yards and featuring a skinny green, the 9th hole at Fossil Trace is a brute, a definite three-shot hole, and a common bogey. But the day I played it featured a howling head wind which took this long par five and made it near impossible to score well. I don't know if it is generally windy in Golden and if the wind generally runs in your face on this hole, but if it does then this is one of the most difficult holes in the state!"
76,Fossil Trace Golf Club,non100,"Golden, CO",Jim Engh,2003,FOSSIL TRACE GOLF CLUB,Two Guys Who Golf,rev076_fossil_trace_2,"Fossil Trace in Golden Colorado, in our opinion - is the MUST PLAY course in the Denver region. Jim Engh deserves credit for coming up with a gorgeous design but he had some top rate golf property to work with. Named as the 2nd Best New Affordable Course in America by Golf Digest in 2003 and nestled in the foothills of the Rocky Mountain's front range, this course simply put is one of the most interesting layouts we have encountered anywhere!
Fossil Trace has been honored as a 4-1/2 star course by Golf Digest Places to Play since 2006, and was also named the Best Course in Denver by ESPN.com from 2006 to the present. With rates topping out at around $75 prime time including cart (residents have discounted rates), this also is one of the best golf values in the country. The property is also home to the Fossil Trace Golf Academy, with a great variety of lessons, clinics and golf schools available. The Junior and Family golf programs are some of the best the state has to offer.
On property is a clubhouse with pro shop and restaurant/lounge serving breakfast, lunch and dinner menus. The outdoor patio features spectacular vistas of the golf course and surrounding area, and there also are separate outing/event facilities. Visage GPS is standard on all carts, but the course is also well marked with yardage stones measured to the front, middle and back of the green from 75 yards out to 275 yards out.
There are 7 sets of tees that play to distances of 6831, 6577, 6241, 5933, 5559, 5197 and 4681 with slopes ranging from 117 to 138 and ratings from 66.5 to 72.3. Golfers familiar with Engh designs will be accustomed to the long, deep, penal, intricately designed soft sand bunkers that highlight his layouts - and they are plentiful on this beautiful course. There are just 37 sand traps located along the fairways or situated greenside, but the strategic placing and length of the designs truly make these bunkers hazardous.
Players will find the 12th hole memorable - with stunning red rock outcroppings and formations situated in the middle of the fairway and greenside. Another unique characteristic is the frequent occurrence of bowl effect fairways and slopes greenside that feed the ball towards the hole. The opening hole is also a stunner - as the approach plays downhill over or around a unique chimney rock formation that is situated in the center of the fairway. Several holes play from elevated tees, and most of the green complexes are protected by sand traps, mounds and swales forming collection areas that create challenging up and down situations. The putting surfaces are often multi tiered and very undulating.
The water features are spectacular, and affect the tee shots or approaches on 7 of the holes, including the beautiful finishing hole, which is highlighted by a lake that runs the length of the hole and demands an accurate approach to small sloping green. Practice facilities on property include a targeted grass range, short game area with sand bunker plus large putting green."
77,Black Diamond Ranch (Quarry),non100,"Lecanto, FL",Tom Fazio,1997,"Black Diamond Ranch (Quarry) (Lecanto, Florida)",Bill Satterfield,rev077_black_diamond_1,"The Takeaway:  Non-typical of Florida golf, the Quarry course at Black Diamond Ranch features large elevation changes and is highlighted by five holes that are routed through a former rock quarry. In addition to offering some stellar photo ops, the course is much more fun than the standard residential Florida track.  Grade B+

What to Expect:  When you play golf in Florida, you don't expect a lot of elevation changes or movement in the terrain. So teeing it up on the Quarry course at Black Diamond Ranch is a treat as it is rare to find a flat hole. Holes 13-17 are clearly the highlight of the course as they are routed through a former rock quarry and feature dramatic hole designs and landscape, however the holes leading up to them are great as well and would get more acclaim if the quarry holes weren't so stunning. The variety of the par fours is particularly outstanding while the greens throughout the course aren't terribly compelling compared to most Fazio courses and could benefit from a renovation to the putting surfaces. The opening tee shot of the day sets the tone right off the bat with a dramatic 45 foot drop down to the fairway and then facing a slightly uphill approach shot. While some of the holes play through a residential neighborhood, they don't feel on top of you as much as they do at the Ranch course due to the distance the homes sit off the fairway and how the heavier tree lines that frame the fairways help deliver some isolation. The par threes are certainly a highlight, particularly in the Quarry, but the course's weakest feature is the routing that necessitates riding in a cart to cover the lack of continuity through portions of the course. Overall, the Quarry course at Black Diamond Ranch is a very good track to enjoy with plenty of movement in the terrain, but it is the quarry holes that make it what it is.

Individual Hole Analysis
Signature Hole:  15th Hole – 371 Yard Par 4 – One of the most recognizable holes in all of Florida, the 15th at Black Diamond Ranch's Quarry course is stunning to behold. This relatively short par four features water up the entire left side with bunkering meandering its way along the fairway and all the way to the green. The elevated tee is exciting to hit from but also can cause some trepidation since the fairway gets thinner the further towards the green it gets. There is a small second fairway on the right that can be laid up to if avoiding the water becomes the primary concern, but a drive down the center of the main fairway will set up a great birdie opportunity. The green moves to the left away from players with the water become a greater concern on the approach shot and will require some guts to go after the day's flag.
15th Hole at Black Diamond Ranch (Quarry) (371 Yard Par 4)
Best Par 3:  13th Hole – 183 Yards – The beginning of the quarry holes is found here at the one-shot 13th. An impressive golf hole, the tee shot plays over a former digging area to a green perched on the high ground on the opposite side. A half dozen bunkers surround the green with the largest portion of the putting surface accounting for the near side of the green while the pin position in the smaller rear shelf of the green will take serious skill to hit. It is an exciting tee shot and great way to start the Quarry's stunning set of upcoming holes.
13th Hole at Black Diamond Ranch (Quarry) (183 Yard Par 3)
Best Par 4:  16th Hole – 435 Yards – A challenging two-shotter that runs along the northern end of the former quarry site, the 16th plays uphill to a fairway that is difficult to see but bunkers on the inside of the hole do stand out as a visual to work from. The ideal tee shot carries the boulders ahead and stays left of the bunker on the right. The further left you go, the greater the award for the approach, but missing too far left will often result in a lost ball. The approach shot will need to carry a chasm to a bunkerless greensite with a small bulb upfront and much more room in the rear half of the green. The slope in the green can be utilized to come up the right side and work the ball back towards the center of the putting surface.
16th Hole at Black Diamond Ranch (Quarry) (435 Yard Par 4)
Best Par 5:  5th Hole – 577 Yards – The only non-quarry hole featured in the review, the par five 5th is a solid hole for being found on the less engaging portion of the property. The tee shot plays to a fairway that slopes from left to right which is why the fairway bunker is found on the right side. An oak tree with Spanish moss on the left side of the fairway is a good target and will be more predominantly in view during the second shot. The fairway then runs straight ahead before the green bends to the right and is tucked behind a bunker. Getting home in two is a real challenge, so staying up the left side will provide the best angle to attack the green on the third shot.
5th Hole at Black Diamond Ranch (Quarry) (577 Yard Par 5)
Birdie Time:  14th Hole – 529 Yard Par 5 – Wrapping around the southern portion of the former quarry, the 14th is a risk/reward par five that presents a great opportunity to take a stroke back from Old Man Par. The fairway wraps from right to left and will temp players to challenge the left side knowing that a hook into the quarry will quickly result in a lost ball. But players who successfully challenge the left side will be in the go-zone for attacking the green in two. The green sits down quite a bit from the fairway and promotes players hitting the fairway right of the green and utilizing the slope in the terrain to tumble the ball onto the putting surface; though the longer grass can hold it up at times. This is an exciting hole and laying up doesn't guarantee a great look at the green due to its depressed site.
14th Hole at Black Diamond Ranch (Quarry) (529 Yard Par 5)
Bogey Beware:  17th Hole – 214 Yard Par 3 – Tom Fazio isn't going to let you out of the quarry without one last challenge, in fact, it is the course's biggest challenge. The lengthy one-shotter plays over a dig site to a smallish green with a strong tier across it. The tier creates a small front third and a much larger back two-thirds in the green and nowhere to miss that you'll be happy with. The rock wall on the left will give a multitude of different kicks while the gnarly grass bunkers on the right will have inconsistent lies that will be challenging to save par from. This hole stands as the most challenging green in regulation to hit on the course and pars here should be celebrated.

78,Black Diamond Ranch (Quarry),non100,"Lecanto, FL",Tom Fazio,1997,Black Diamond Ranch (Quarry),top100golfcourses,rev078_black_diamond_2,"Designed by Tom Fazio and opened in 1987, the Quarry course is not a typical Florida course because it has so many changes in elevation. It is an integral part of what is considered to be the number one golf community in the state. Together with the 18-hole Ranch course, 9-hole Highlands course, 30-bay driving range and 800 homes, this development is contained within 1,320 acres of land.

The Black Diamond Ranch Quarry course features prominently in every recent American golf course survey and it’s obvious straight from the off. Early in your round at the Quarry course you can’t help but marvel at the dogwoods, myrtles and magnolias that line the fairways, but you can’t help your mind racing on in anticipation of what lies ahead. From the 13th to the 17th, the Quarry course takes on its signature character – these holes are fashioned over and around canyon walls which offer excitement and spectacular views.

At the 13th hole, you stand on the elevated tee seventy-five feet above the quarry floor and catch your breath as you look over a huge abyss in front of the green 183 yards away – some have likened it to playing the 8th hole at Pebble Beach. Corey Pavin loves the 15th; in fact, he thinks it’s the most beautiful golf hole in Florida. The tee sits over seventy-five feet above the fairway and water is in play down the entire left side to a green that is tucked around the edge of the water – it's such a stunning hole that it is really hard to focus on the task at hand.

The last of these five fabulous holes is the par three 17th, which is 204 yards of rugged beauty that demands accuracy. There are lateral hazards on both sides of this hole, large bunkers on the right side of the green and quarry walls on the left – a great conclusion to the wonderful Quarry course at Black Diamond Ranch."

The former home club of golfing legend Bobby Jones, the impressive clubhouse is laced with memorabilia from Jones’ illustrious career. The club used to welcome standard memberships, but is in the process of converting everything into corporate memberships where the club can entertain clients near downtown Atlanta. The Donald Ross design can best be described as “pleasant” with gentle contours and a relaxing setting. Trees line the fairways but are sparse enough that the golfer is afforded views of much of the course from several different locations on the property. Not only does East Lake host the Tour Championship at the end of the PGA Tour season, the course formerly finished with a par three until the nines were reversed.
Individual Hole Analysis
Signature Hole:  15th Hole – 213 Yard Par 3 – The first island green in America was designed as the 15th hole at East Lake Golf Club in Atlanta (originally the 6th hole). Already a challenging target to hit, the club has pushed the championship tee box back to behind the lake and requires the golfer to fly the ball 200+ yards over water before seeing any signs of dry land. This heroic tee shot will instantly put a smile or a frown on your face.
15th Hole at East Lake Golf Club (213 Yard Par 3)
Best Par 3:  9th Hole – 232 Yards – For years this was the finishing hole, but the PGA Tour didn't like closing on a par three for the Tour Championship and so the nines were reversed. Uphill all the way, the tee shot on the 9th may be your most challenging all day. A pond sits in front of the tee box and isn't in play for most golfers, but the deep bunkers on either side of this sloping green factor in for everyone. If you get above the hole, your knees will be knocking trying to corral your next shot near the hole at the most difficult two-tiered green on the course.
9th Hole at East Lake Golf Club (232 Yard Par 3)
Best Par 4:  17th Hole – 407 Yards – The second shortest par four on the course is also one of its best. The tees have been lengthed from the original layout and have made it increasingly difficult to contend with and carry the trees and bunkers protecting the inside corner of this dogleg left. A deep mote bunker encirles the front of the firm green and demands distance control from the golfer's approach shot in order to make birdie a legit option.
17th Hole at East Lake Golf Club (407 Yard Par 4)
Best Par 5:  18th Hole – 589 Yards – The 18th hole is my favorite at East Lake and delivers the challenge and options I love to see in a golf hole. Off the tee the line isn't completely clear to a first time visitor as the fairway dives downhill and to the left out of view. With water looming in the distance the golfer must decide between a fairway metal off the tee and likely having to layup on the second shot, or whether to pound the driver up the left side in hopes of finding the fairway and the slope of the fairway which will feed the ball into position in order to reach the green in two. The safer tee shot up the right side of the hole brings water into play on the second shot as the player can use the clubhouse in the distance as an aiming target. A pair of deep bunkers protect the green that angles away from the golfer and finishes off an excellent grouping of challenges on this hole.
18th Hole at East Lake Golf Club (589 Yard Par 5)
Birdie Time:  14th Hole – 559 Yard Par 5 – Anytime a hole is shortened a tad and considered a par four for the PGA Tour, it offers an excellent chance for us regular guys to score a birdie when it plays as a par five. That is the case on the 5th hole at East Lake that plays well downhill and generates some forwards kick in the fairway that setup long iron approach shots to reach this green in two. Beyond the green a large pond looms, but the front of the green is open and accepting to shots chasing into the putting surface. I got lucky the day I played at East Lake and was able to stick my 220 yard approach shot to kick-in distance of the hole and carded a rare eagle.
14th Hole at East Lake Golf Club (559 Yard Par 5)
Bogey Beware:  2nd Hole – 455 Yard Par 4 – How this hole ranks as the #14 handicap on the card baffles me. Water runs the entire left side of the hole with the fairway sloping toward the hazard. Bailing out to the right opens up the green while at the same time requiring precise distance control on the approach to avoid the water behind the green while hitting the ball hard enough to carry the steep slope fronting the green. The deep bunkers surrounding the putting surface are difficult to save par out of if thoughts of fear run through your mind of skulling it into the water. This hole is a beast.

Tom Bendelow originally designed the East Lake course as a golfing accompaniment for the members of the Atlanta Athletic Club. The course was laid out in the suburbs of Atlanta on the site of an old amusement park and the course opened for play in July 1908. A young six-year old called Bob was at the East Lake opening ceremony in the company of his father, Colonel Robert P. Jones.
East Lake Golf Club played host to the 1963 Ryder Cup matches between the USA and Great Britain. Team Captains were Arnold Palmer (US) and John Fallon (GB). Britain adopted a new strategy for the 15th edition of Ryder Cup matches using a non-playing Captain for the first time. The US did not follow suit and placed Arnold Palmer at the playing helm. “The King” in his debut as Captain led his team in fine style to the second largest winning margin in Ryder Cup history. USA 23 - GB 9. The Ryder Cup was played at Royal Lytham & St Annes in 1961 and at Royal Birkdale in 1965.

In 1913, the famous Scottish architect Donald Ross redesigned East Lake creating two loops of nine holes and in 1928 he returned to fashion a second East Lake course which opened in 1930 to coincide with Bobby’s Grand Slam victory celebrations. Beverly Hanson won the 1950 U.S. Women’s Amateur here, accepting the Robert Cox Trophy from Bobby Jones.

George Cobb made a few minor alterations to the original course ahead of the 1963 Ryder Cup which culminated in a resounding 23 points to 9 victory for Team USA against a beleaguered Great Britain & Ireland squad.

East Lake’s luck soon changed after the 1963 Ryder Cup as the Atlanta neighbourhood fell into urban decline. The Atlanta Athletic Club sold the second course to developers and moved out. But 25 members stepped in and saved the original course and formed the East Lake Golf Club. In the early 1970s public housing was built on the site of No.2 course and the area soon became a center for poverty, drugs and violence. East Lake slowly but surely degenerated.

In Golf Courses of the PGA Tour by George Peper, the author states: “Enter its saviour, Tom Cousins. A prosperous real estate developer who had developed the Omni Complex and NationsBank Plaza in downtown Atlanta, Cousins had fond memories of East Lake from when he had played it as a youngster in the 1940s. Employing the resources of his own charitable foundation he revamped the golf club and used it as a tool to revitalize the surrounding area.

The housing project was razed and replaced with 500 mixed-income apartments and townhouses surrounding the golf course... At the same time, Cousins sold 100 corporate memberships at $75,000 each (asking each corporation to contribute an additional $200,000 to the revival of the area).”

In 1994, Rees Jones was called in. Using the original drawings, Donald Ross’s 1926 design was re-born. Today’s East Lake is the driving force behind the effort to revitalise this Atlanta neighbourhood. All profits from the club go to support the East Lake Community Foundation and as a consequence East Lake now stands as a symbol of hope as well as tradition.

In addition to staging the 1963 Ryder Cup matches, East Lake also held the 2001 US Amateur Championship which was claimed by Bubba Dickerson, winning the last two holes of the 36-hole final for a thrilling 1-up victory. East Lake is also host venue for the season-ending Tour Championship, which has been held consecutively here in Atlanta since 2004."

The facilities are understated as you might expect from a men's club that only cares about one thing; golf. You won't find homes on the course or traditional country club facilities like swimming pools or tennis courts, just the necessary elements to operate a upper end golf course. A prompt pace of play is accomplished with wide fairways and a membership that appreciates that style of play. The layout is characterized by risk/reward play where the more you are willing to challenge hazards off the tee, the greater the angle for the second shot and ability to score well. Though the property isn't as undulated or architecture as elite, Black Sheep reminded me of Shinnecock Hills with the inland links vibe and the clubhouse sitting on top of the highest point on the property. The fact that this club is being mentioned in the same sentence as Shinnecock Hills ought to tell you just how great Black Sheep is.
Individual Hole Analysis
Signature Hole:  9th Hole – 419 Yard Par 4 – The closing hole of the opening nine plays uphill towards the farm style clubhouse and runs parallel to the club's entrance road. With no protection from the wind, players will often find their tee shot getting knocked down some and will then need to take a longer club into the green to combat the wind and uphill terrain. The approach shot to this flag is one of the most challenging of the day with part of the green being blind, particularly from the right side of the fairway. This blind look proved to be especially suspenseful after Rich's 181 yard approach shot went pinseeking. Upon cresting the putting surface, we discovered his ball in the bottom of the cup; yet another eagle for a guy that seems to hole out from everywhere except the tee box as the search for his first hole in one continues to elude him.

Best Par 3:  3rd Hole – 204 Yards – The first one-shotter at Black Sheep is also its best. Playing downhill the entire way to the green, this hole is attractively framed by bunkers and trees to give it a memorable and inviting look. The putting surface is large and undulated enough to generate its fair share of three-putts, especially for those that may not have adjusted to the green speeds yet.
3rd Hole at Black Sheep Golf Club (204 Yard Par 3)
Best Par 4:  5th Hole – 305 Yards – This drivable par four is half angel and half devil. The short distance unveils the angel side of the hole as players start salivating at the chance of an easy birdie. However the devil side quickly surfaces if players go for the green and aren't deadly accurate due to the water, bunkering, and unplayable areas protecting the hole. The smart play is to take an iron off the tee and then wedge it into the green, but that is only if you are able to listen to the angel on your shoulder and not the devil.
5th Hole at Black Sheep Golf Club (305 Yard Par 4)
Best Par 5:  2nd Hole – 535 Yards – When I got to the 2nd hole I knew I was going to like Black Sheep. The creativity of the fairway contours, attractive bunkering, and strategy found on this hole are highlights of the front nine design. Bunkers are found on each side of the fairway near the common landing zone. Players that challenge the bunker on the right and successfully carry their tee ball 250 yards to clear it will be rewarded with a great chance to reach the green in two with a hybrid or long iron. However, the entire right side of the green is protected by a large bunker that stares back at players daring to take a rip at the green. The circular green is 32 yards deep with plenty of pin positions that may dictate your aggressiveness with your second shot.
2nd Hole at Black Sheep Golf Club (535 Yard Par 5)
Birdie Time:  18th Hole – 497 Yard Par 5 – Even going uphill, any sub-500 yard par five should have players looking to take a stroke back from old man par. Though some fairway bunkering can thwart the goal of taking a four here, the fairway is pretty generous and reaching this green in two can often be done with less than a fairway wood. While the PGA Tour may prefer to finish championship courses with a long par four, us everyday Joe's love to have an easy hole to go out on so that we can walk off the course with a smile on our face and this is your chance.
18th Hole at Black Sheep Golf Club (497 Yard Par 5)
Bogey Beware:  14th Hole – 464 Yard Par 4 – This lengthy par four plays to a driving zone that is tightened down by a bunker on the right and garbage on the left. The green features one of the more narrow openings on the course and is protected on the right by a large bunker. With the wind likely whipping through the course at this point in the round, you'll need to be on your 'A' game to conquer this two-shotter.

One of four men’s only clubs in the state of Illinois (which makes up about a fifth to sixth of the total in the US), Solano developed Black Sheep to provide its membership a true home-away-from-home, with a comfortable but well-appointed, functional open clubhouse with a locker room, pro shop and a great room / bar area. It has everything it needs, and little it doesn’t.

There is no pool. No tennis courts. No dining room. No dress code.

There are no menus and no kitchen. The dining options are burger or chicken sandwich from the grill out back, or their famous peanut butter and jalapeno sandwich (there may have been a few pre-made options in the refrigerator that I missed).

There is no waitstaff. In fact, there are very few employees, in general, although those who are there including PGA Head Golf Professional Kevin Healy are tremendously helpful and accommodating, and will help throughout the clubhouse.


Black Sheep: One of the best logos in golf.

All of this adds up to an intimate experience with low overhead. That means members get an elite, top-100 club with the lowest dues of any private course in the Chicago area (just over $7k/year, although initiation is ~ $35k), no food and beverage minimums, and no reliance on outside cash flow. With no need to host outside events on Mondays, for example, the course is open to membership seven days a week.

Black Sheep has 27 holes of fantastic David Esler designed golf that ebbs and inhales across a vast 285 acres of Illinois prairie land.

The holes Esler laid out will test every club in the bag, and will reward players who can pull off drawn and cut shot shapes while allowing for straight and steady play down its forgiving fairways.

The golf course at Black Sheep is one of the best competition courses I’ve ever played.

In fact, it played host this day to our 2019 Illinois vs. Wisconsin Writer’s Cup match.

A look back at the clubhouse from beyond the tenth hole green site.

One of my favorite holes on the course is the lightning bolt shaped par five 11th. The fairway runs out from the tee, and helped turbo-charge my 275-ish yard drive well over 300.

Any 200-yard shot at the green in two, though, will need to carry a ton of greenside bunkers and would be ill-advised, at best. There is a ton of room short and left of the green for laying up and leaves a great angle in.


A look at the fairway transition on the par five 11th, from around 260 yards out.

The course uses elevation well, especially on the par threes. My favorite is the short 25th, measuring just 135 yards to a postage stamp sized green that slopes hard from back to front.

Proximity on the tee shot is the whole game here. Anything outside 15 feet will leave a challenging two-putt, and anything short will likely be marooned well below the putting surface.


The short par three 25th hole, from 135 yards over fescue and sand.

One of my favorite holes on the course is the par five second. Tipping out at 535 yards, this is a great three-shot hole that will penalize players for getting overly aggressive.


The par five 2nd hole at Black Sheep

An intimidating expanse of sand to carry to get home on the par five 2nd.

The third is a beautiful downhill par three with a bevy of teeing options. The tee box nearest the second hole green is the highest, and forces players to take on more of the sand traps front-right of the green.


Tee highest tee box on 3, fairly straight-on.

The next set of tees offers a straight-on approach with a clear lane to the green, and slightly less elevation.


Different tee, different angle on 3.

The fifth continues my favorite stretch of holes at Black Sheep Golf Club, a drivable par four that is risk/reward at its very best.

Under 300 yards to the green, the putting surface is partially hidden by a volcano bunker front-left, and is one of the most heavily sloped greens on the course.

Any attempt at hitting this green better be straight. Errant shots left will likely disappear in the fescue, and anything short-right will be swallowed up by the pond.


Options galore! Line and club selection are key off the tee on 5.

Esler designed great width in to the longer holes, generating a lot of options for how they can be played. This is the case on the par five sixth, the longest hole on the course tipping out at a beefy 618 yards.


Tee shot on the 600-plus yard par five 6th

The approach shot on the par five 6th.

By the green on six is where I noticed something little but interesting at Black Sheep: A new way of hiding trash cans. Rather than having the standard garbage cans near tee boxes, their refuse bins are buried in the ground with a pop-up button to step on that opens the lid.

Another Chicago-area course with a creative way of hiding otherwise unsightly on-course amenities is the Greg Martin designed Rich Harvest Farms. RHF buries their rakes near sand traps with a button that pops them up when needed… For whatever reason, I always enjoy seeing creative new ways of doing the mundane.

Because there are 27 holes, there is no true starting or finishing hole at Black Sheep. Instead there are three, and all three nines end with strong uphill layouts returning to the perched clubhouse.

A view of the ninth:

The eighteenth is my favorite of the finishing holes at Black Sheep. Climbing sharply uphill, the green is perched before the clubhouse and provides no visual of the ball landing. The approach has to carry the greenside bunkers and mounded front edge, so spin control is important.

The 27th is intimidating off the tee, with fescue that looks to encroach on the driving area from all directions. The fairways are wide, though, at Black Sheep, and the uphill approach shot is to the bottom section of the otherwise shared 2-acre practice putting green.


Just a sliver of fairway shows through shrouded tees on the 27th.

The thirteenth is the longest par three on the course at Black Sheep, tipping out at 241 yards.


The long par three 13th.

Maybe my favorite green complex on a course with tremendous greens is the putting surface on the par four 23rd. A double-ripple effect divides the green, twice, running from front-left to back-right, and the day’s pin location was just paces from the right edge.

85,Crooked Stick Golf Club,non100,"Carmel, IN",Pete Dye,1964,Hole-by-hole: Crooked Stick Golf Club,Bradley Klein,rev085_crooked_stick_1,"CARMEL, Ind. – Crooked Stick Golf Club is one of Pete Dye’s earliest gems and the course that put him on the map as an iconoclastic genius. Located 12 miles north of downtown Indianapolis in what used to be the sleepy farm community of Carmel, the course opened up in 1967 to rave reviews for its adaptation of classical-era design principles.

It took Dye three years of work to hew the low-lying site into golf ground. Halfway through, he and his wife, Alice, made a sojourn to Scotland where they witnessed for the first time steep-faced bunkers stabilized by railroad ties, fairways that dead-ended and greens whose contours defied the natural surrounds.

Here Dye drew upon the designers who most inspired him: Donald Ross, Alister MacKenzie and Seth Raynor. But he also added a unique Midwestern sensibility, including everything from knee-high prairie grasses, rocky streams, covered bridges and a railroad car. The result, as witnessed nationally during the 1991 PGA Championship, the 1993 U.S. Women’s Open, the 2005 Solheim Cup and the 2009 U.S. Senior Open, is a demanding yet enticing layout that emphasizes aerial strength, proper angles of approach, and a tolerance for crazy bounces.

For the 2012 BMW Championship the course will play to par-72, 7,497 yards long, with a 77.7 rating and a slope of 148.

No. 1, par 4, 358 yards
Dye, ever the curmudgeon, doesn’t believe in drivable par-4s. “That’s why they have par-3s,” he grouses. But he always has a short, delicate par 4 in the mix, though rarely as the opening hole. This one, somewhat over-treed down the right side and around the putting surface, calls for a layup to a narrow fairway and a short-iron to a very well protected green that’s segmented into two distinct pods on a right-to-left angle. Miss the proper pod and it’s a difficult putt to get to the other one.

No. 2, par 4, 442 yards
Dye is a great admirer of Ross’ Seminole Golf Club because of the need there to play shots both ways – a draw tee shot followed by a fade approach, and on the next hole the other way around. That’s exactly the principle in play at Crooked Stick, where after a light fade on the first hole you need to hit a long, powerful right-to-left tee shot, though even the longest hitters can’t carry the massive MacKenzie-like bunker that runs along the left side of the fairway to a distance of 335 yards off the tee. In typical strategic fashion, the ideal line is as close to the bunkers on the inside of the dogleg left as possible. From the fairway – one of eight that was narrowed over the winter in the landing area – it’s a fade approach to a narrow, elevated green that runs away from the player at the back.

No. 3, par 3, 195 yards
If you’ve ever wondered what Donald Ross on drugs would have designed, just stand on the tee here. Slightly uphill, with pop-up bunkers edging into the line of play on this kidney-shaped green. It’s accessible to a right-to-left shot, but anything running a tad long will quickly find sand, so distance control is crucial. Dye is convinced that PGA Tour players rarely miss on distance short or long; they just miss right or left, which is why so many of the greens here are narrow at the waist.

No. 4, par 4, 483 yards
The fairway landing area is at its narrowest at 300 yards, so keeping the drive in play and out of a handful of bunkers is crucial. On this long hole, it’s a fade drive and a draw approach to a green where it’s very easy to hang the ball out to the right and end up with a delicate up-and-over greenside recovery.

No. 5, par 5, 612 yards
A big, sweeping dogleg left, where the favorable angle off the tee on the right is littered with steep bunkers. With the prevailing wind out of the southwest, this hole plays down breeze over the right shoulder. Some players will reach the green in two, though holding the plateau and avoiding the Raynor-like steep falloffs around will be the difficulty. There’s a lot to be said for holding back on the second shot with a middle iron and coming at the green with full third shot that has control and spin on it.

No. 6, par 3, 201 yards
This hole is a paradigm of Midwest Americana, what with a farm pond lapping the right side of the green and a wooden, red-painted, covered bridge presiding over the back of the hole. There’s a cross ridge in the green that segments the front downslope from the back half of the green – where the slope feeds the ball right. The prevailing wind is from behind, which makes it harder to stay on the back right shelf when the hole is cut there and brings water more into play.


No. 7, par 4, 454 yards
Here’s the lull before the storm. Pretty straightforward, a left-to-right drive past an inconsequential fairway bunker on the right followed by a right-to-left middle iron to a fall-away green.

No. 8, par 4, 456 yards
Dye is a master of the break-neck dogleg; this one a hard left around the corner of a lake running along the entire inside of the hole. By suspending the target green over the horizon of the dominant hazard, he tempts strong players into playing an aggressive line when in a fact the smarter line is away; but good players hate turning their back on the flag and playing so far away. Here, it’s a right-to-left tee shot to a green with a bunker on the right and the surface tipped down to the water on the left. It actually sets up best for a perfectly controlled high fade – another example of how Crooked Stick demands you play both ways. More than any other hole on the course, the shift in structure makes you feel unsettled.


No. 9, par 5, 530 yards
This is one of those holes that John Daly, with his prodigious length during the 1991 PGA Championship, simply obliterated by driving over trees and the maintenance barn, leaving Dye in a quandary about how to test the new generation of long-ball hitters. He since has adjusted the hole so that there’s a huge bunker on the inside left of this dogleg that now requires a 305-yard carry to the sweet spot in the fairway. From there, the shot into the green of 200-plus yards has to thread a chute of trees and hold one of the smaller putting surfaces on the course.


No. 10, par 4, 397 yards
The back nine, on the south side of the property, kicks off with a modest-length hole where hitting the fairway is crucial thanks to water right and long pits of sand down both sides of the landing area. No drivers needed here, as a fairway wood or even a long iron will leave a short pitch left to a green with its high side right and a surface that cants steadily to the left. Once again, the ideal line off the tee is as close to the biggest trouble (on the right) along the fairway.


No. 11, par 5, 595 yards
This northbound par 5 plays with the prevailing wind over the player’s left shoulder and will likely yield some eagles. The hole actually starts with a new tee that creates a cross-over tee shot with Crooked Stick’s other par 5 on this nine, the 15th. The drive (to another one of those recently narrowed fairways) has to avoid a long, nasty collection of bathtub bunkers and potholes 250-350 yards off the on the left. A bold second shot into the low-lying green has to carry what looks like a cratered Sahara – this to a green canted on a diagonal that effectively shortens the depth of this well-protected green. The alternative, an option that Tour players hate, is to turn 30 degrees to the left and play a middle-iron into a dead-ended fairway and from there flip a wedge down along the more receptive main axis of the green.


No. 12, par 4, 424 yards
Dye is a genius at taking what most other architects would build as a straight hole and turning it into a confounding double-dogleg. The unbunkered fairway has a big kink in the lower right side – exactly where, from the tee, you mistakenly want to line up. The fairway forces you left, and from a draw stance you have to hit a shot that holds up against one of those steep fall-off, low-cut chipping areas that Dye – influenced by Pinehurst – occasionally relies upon.


No. 13, par 3, 182 yards
Only Dye would have the “chutzpah” (that’s a technical design term) to create a dogleg par 3, this one requiring a shot around a looming oak tree on the left. The tough part here is that this fall-away green sits near a creek that will gobble up approach shots hit short or a touch to the right.


No. 14, par 4, 497 yards
Here’s another of those holes that Daly eviscerated in 1991, turning what had been a strategic dogleg with a creek on the inside of the left elbow into a pitch-and-putt hole. The drive has since been toughened and lengthened, and because it plays into the prevailing breeze it’s not an automatic carry: 290 yards over the corner. Tug it a bit and you’re left in deep rough with a bad angle in; play it out to the right and you’re faced with an uphill approach of 200-plus yards to a green with steep bunkering flanking both sides up front and a surface that feeds everything to the left.


No. 15, par 5, 523 yards
Straight into the prevailing wind, this nominally short par 5 plays longer than it first looks. A massive, claw-like bunker runs the length of the left side of the landing area and cannot be outgunned, so drives have to steer clear because landing in it means a second shot blasted out wide right and short of the green. The target here, at 63 yards long, is far and away the biggest green on the course; also the most vexing, because it’s a MacKenzie-style wraparound surface, seen originally as the famed seventh at Crystal Downs Golf Club in Michigan and again as the 15th hole at another MacKenzie design that Dye has admired, the University of Michigan Golf Course. The banana-shaped green wraps around a mid-left-center bunker and is barely accessible from front to back by putting. The excitement comes when the only way to get a ball from the front lobe to the back is to clip it with a lob wedge. That makes for great theater, if a very upset green superintendent.

No. 16, par 4, 470 yards
Slightly downhill, decidedly downwind, and so the steep bunkers lining the fairways ending at 285 yards out can be readily passed. Here’s the most obvious example of a secret Dye trick: on all of his courses, his fairway bunkers are aligned to the front of the green and his greenside bunkers point to the back of the putting surface. The tough trick here is steering wide of a pond that laps the length of the green on the right – while avoiding a very deep bunker front left.

No. 17, par 3, 212 yards
If you ever want to renovate a Dye course, don’t hire Pete to do it. He never gets it right and loses his initial vision somewhat. He has tinkered with this hole endlessly at Crooked Stick, and it has acquired a harder, more aggressive shaping in the process as he deepens the greenside bunker on what amounts to your basic Redan hole: steep bunker left guarding the back left of a fall-away green. The wind here from the left on this exposed, elevated tee tends to push approaches to the right, leaving a delicate up-and-over recovery.

No. 18, par 4, 457 yards
You gotta love the suggestion box in the middle of the vast lake that laps the entire right side of this graceful dogleg right. Dye, who lives in a house left of the fairway, has been the club’s green committee of one for five decades and dutifully reads his mail. The sweep of this hole makes it very difficult to commit to a tee-shot line because there are no bunkers or trees for alignment. The approach shot has to deal with a bulk-headed green that sits low to the water and has three pot bunkers pulled back way to the left. If you’re in these, you have your hands full with the proverbial long bunker shot to a green that slopes into the water. The ideal line of play is a left-to-right drive and a right-to-left approach – tough shots to pull off under pressure."
86,Crooked Stick Golf Club,non100,"Carmel, IN",Pete Dye,1964,The Stick - Crooked Stick Golf Club,Jimmie Hames,rev086_crooked_stick_2,"On the morning of July 13, I took a crooked path to get to the Crooked Stick Golf Club.  I’d driven to Indianapolis from Erin, Wisconsin on the night before.  That morning I checked out of my hotel. I put Crooked Stick Golf Course in my GPS.  And off I went.  As I drove through the neighborhood approaching the Club, I started to get the feeling that I was heading to the wrong place.  As I arrived at the Crooked Stick Golf Course, it became very clear that this was not the Club that was ranked 94th on the Golf Digest 2017-18 Top 100 list.  I called Doug Hicks who had coordinated the round at the club with his brother Bob.  Bob is a member.  Doug provided me with the actual address of the club.

I put the club address into my GPS and was again on my way.  Problem solved.  So, I thought.  The GPS took me to the back of the club where there is no entrance.  Another phone call to Doug and a discussion with the Assistant Pro in the Golf Shop led to me arriving at the Club just minutes before our intended tee time.  I hit a couple of balls on the practice range with my driver before I headed to the first tee to join our group.  We were playing as a fivesome.  Doug’s brother had initially set us up to play with another member, Mike Kilkenny, because he didn’t think he would be available.  Fortunately, he could join us for the first 12 holes.  Doug’s youngest brother, Brian was the other member of our group of five. Jordan, our forecaddie introduced himself before he headed out to the fairway to track our tee shots. 

The first hole at the Crooked Stick Golf Club is a short par 4.  We played from the blue tees which measured just over 6650 yards with a slope of 73.3 and a rating of 135. The first hole was playing around 325 yards.  It has a generous fairway, but very little rough between the fairway and the trees that line both sides of that fairway.  The trees on the left are thick and come into play immediately if you hit your drive to the left.  The trees on the right are more spacious and forgiving. I hit my drive long, but to the right.  The ball was playable and only about 60 yards from the flag, with a small tree between it and the green. I could probably have easily cleared the tree with a lob wedge.  I was told however that it is customary to hit a second tee shot off the first tee if you miss the fairway.  My second drive on the first tee was just as long as the first, but it was down the middle of the fairway.

I didn’t take advantage of the generosity granted me on the first hole.  Oh yes, I did play the second drive rather than the first, I just shanked my approach shot from 60 yards out and ended up to the right of the green.  From there I chipped on and two putted for an opening hole bogey.

The second hole plays 385 yards.  It has a slight dogleg left and one of those customary long Pete Dye bunkers near the landing zone on the left side of the fairway.  Mike Kilkenny served as my guide for the day.  He was very knowledgeable of the course and offered great advice on where to hit my shots.  On the second hole, he advised that I hit down the right side of the fairway.  He pointed to a tree in the distance, just past where the fairway makes the slight left turn, as my target line.  I hit along that line and landed on the right side of the fairway with a nice angle to the flag, but the flag was tucked behind a small bunker on the right front of the green.

I missed the green on my approach shot, chipped to within five feet of the cup.  My par putt skimmed the left edge of the cup, but didn’t drop in.  I tapped in for a second bogey.  Two fairways hit and two missed greens.  Not a good start on the most playable course I’d faced all week.

The third hole is a medium arrange par 3. It’s the first of four par 3s on the course, but the only one without water.  It measures 170 yards to the middle of the green, but the pin was positioned on the back left portion of the green, so it was playing 180 yards.  I hit a 5 iron on a straight line to and then past the flag into the bunker behind the green.  It took me to shots to get out of the bunker and two putts to get the ball in the cup.  I was hitting the ball well at this point, but it wasn’t reflected in my score of two bogeys and a double bogey on the first three holes.

The fourth hole is a long par 4 measuring over 400 yards.  The fair way is lined with several small bunkers on both sides, but more on the right than the left.  Again, Mike gave me a nice line to hit my ball on and my drive found the fairway.  I hit my approach shot over the back of the green.  Again, I chipped on and two putted for another bogey.

The fifth hole is the longest of the four par 5s at Crooked Stick.  It plays 590 yards from the blue tees.  The fairway is narrow for the first 300 yards, then it widens before narrowing again for the last 130 yards before the green.  There are small bunkers along the right side of the fairway, right in the landing zone.  Mike pointed out that it was best to miss to the left.  In addition to avoiding the bunkers, it set you up for a lay up to the right side of the fairway, which has the best angle to the green.

I had my first missed fairway (this excludes my first drive on the first hole since I played my second drive which was in the fairway) when my drive rolled into the left rough. I hit a lay up to the left side of the fairway.  My approach landed in the right green side bunker.  I double bogeyed the hole.

The sixth hole is the signature hole at Crooked Stick.  It is a beautiful par 3 with water, a covered bridge and a big oak tree.  At least it had a big oak tree until a storm brought it down earlier in the week.  As you can imagine, this was a sad moment for the members and staff at Crooked Stick.  The storm also did additional damage to several other holes on the front nine. Following the storm, it wasn’t clear whether we would be able to play the course on Thursday.  Fortunately, the staff worked tirelessly to get the full 18 holes on the course reopened for the membership.  There were minor remnants of debris on the course, but nothing that interfered with play. 

What did interfere with my play was my poor swing on the sixth hole. I hit tee shot long and to the left of the green.  It took me 4 additional shots to hole out for a double bogey.  Doug on the other hand, hit his tee shot onto the green and sank a 60 foot putt for a birdie!

The seventh hole is a wide-open par 4 that plays just over 370 yards.  Mike again gave me a good line for my tee shot and I was able to find the fairway with my drive.  I landed on the left side of the fairway and had a great angle to the green.  I hit my approach shot to within five feet of the flag, but missed the birdie putt.  I settled for my first par of the round.

On the eighth hole, I tried to execute my drive according to Mike’s instructions, but hit a little too far to the right into the rough.  The eighth hole is a 400 yard par 4 with water along the left fairway all the way to the green.  You can understand why Mike advised that I hit my drive to the right side of the fairway.  My approach shot from rough sailed to the right and into the green side bunker. I hit out of the bunker, but just barely, so I didn’t make the green.  I chipped on and hit my customary two putts for a double bogey.

The ninth hole is a short but challenging par 5.  It plays less than 500 yards, but has a lot of trouble for each shot.  There is water along the left side of the fairway and a very large bunker in the landing zone.  The right side of the fairway has trees and the rough.  The creek that runs down the left side of the fairway, crosses the fairway at about 100 yards from the green.  The green side of the bisected fairway has timbers along the bank of the creek.

I hit a great drive on the hole to the middle of the fairway, just over 250 yards out.  I decided to go for the green in two.  This was a mistake.  My ball almost cleared the creek, but hit the timbers on the bank instead and bounced back into the water.  I could retrieve my ball, but that didn’t make up for the penalty stroke I took.  I hit my fourth shot onto the green to about 8 feet from the flag, but rather than putting for a birdie, I was putting to save par.  Had I laid up short of the creek, I could have saved at least one stroke and made an easy par.  Instead, I bogeyed the hole after missing the par putt.

The tenth hole is a medium distance par 4.  It plays 370 yards with water along the right side of the fairway and trees and bunkers along the left side.   I hit my drive way left.  It was far enough left that I had a clear shot to the green.  I missed the green to the left on my approach shot.  I then did what has been come a routine for me and that is chip or pitch on and two putt for bogey.

The 11th hole is a short par 5, measuring a little over 500 yards.  But don’t be fooled by it.  To take advantage of how short it is, you would need to hit a drive over a 5/4 domino of bunkers.  I call it that because there are two groups of bunkers clustered together.  The first group has four bunkers and the second group has five bunkers.  The group of five bunkers is arranged like the five dots on a domino.  It takes about a 240 yard carry from the blue tees to get past the bunkers.  I like dominos, so I took on the bunkers with my drive and landed the ball in the fairway.  This left me about 220 yards from the green.  Rather than thanking my lucky stars and playing it conservatively after that, I decided to take on the next set of bunkers between me and the green. This next set of bunkers consist of only two bunkers, but the first one is about 70 yards long.  If you get past it, there is a large green side bunker waiting.  Well those bunkers proved to not be a problem for me.  I hit my second shot into the fescue way right of the bunkers.  I turned great drive into a seven on my scorecard.

The twelfth hole is a par 4 that plays slightly longer than 400 yards.  It is shaped like a lazy “v”.  The fairway is narrow, but there is ample rough on the left and right if you miss the fairway.  I missed the fairway on the right.  My approach shot missed the green, but as usual, I chipped on and two putted for a bogey.

This had not been a good day for me on the par 3s.  The 150 yard par three thirteenth hole was no different.  While Pete Dye found a crooked stick in the corn field that would become the Crooked Stick Golf Club, I found a Crooked Creek several times on this day.  When Mr. Dye found his crooked stick, he imagined that could have been the way this game we called golf got started.  Perhaps some guy found a stick, decided to hit a rock with it, and then imagined what it would be like to hit that rock into a little hole in the ground.  Mr. Dye decided to change the name of the course he was designing from the originally planned name to Crooked Stick after finding that stick on the property.  I think I should consider calling it Crooked Creek for all the times I found the creek during my round. 

As you can imagine, the creek was in play on the 13th hole and I found it.  I made a double bogey on this par 3 as I had one on the previous two par 3s.

In 1991, John Daly was relatively an unknown in the golf world.  That changed when he won the PGA Championship by dismantling Crook Stick with his ability to hit the ball much farther than any other golfer in the field.  As we stood on the tee box for the fourteenth hole, Mike Kilkenny shared one the many John Daly stories that have become legend for that fateful contesting of the PGA Championship in 1991.

The 14th hole has a dogleg left that is designed to play almost 500 yards as a par 4 from the championship tees.  That crooked creek that I so admire, runs along the left side of the hole and bends with the dogleg.  It is about a 270 to 280 carry to cut the corner and reduce the hole to about a 400 to 420 yard hole from the championship tees.  John Daly was able to easily carry that creek.  While today with all the new technology and the fitness of the golfers, several golfers would be able to carry the creek, but in 1991, only John Daly could do it.  This meant that he could hit short irons or wedges on his approach shot to the green, while the other golfers were hitting long irons.

On this day while I was at Crooked Stick, given my experience with the crooked creek, I chose to avoid as much of the creek as I could.  I followed Mike’s advice to hit the ball to the right.  The hole plays only 420 from the blue tees.  I hit my drive through the fairway into the rough no the right side of the fairway, leaving about 180 yards to the green.  As was my pattern on par fours for the day, I left my approach shot short, pitched on and two putted for a bogey.

The fifteenth hole on the course is the final par 5.  It is a short par five playing only 485 yards from the blue tees. It is a straight forward hole.  The tee box points you toward a bunker along the left side if the fairway.  If you can avoid this bunker, the hole becomes an easy hole.  I avoided the bunker and hit the fairway with my drive, then laid up to about 70 yards.  I then hit the green in regulation leaving myself a makeable birdie putt of about 7 feet.  Unfortunately, the putt wasn’t so makeable for me.  I made par on the hole.

Th sixteenth hole is a straight away par 4 that plays slightly over 400 yards.  It has bunkers on the left and right as the fairway narrows at about 230 yards from the blue tees. I hit my best drive of the day on the 16th hole, leaving myself a nice angle in to the green which had a back middle pin.  The angle also helped to take the water along the right side of the green out of play.  There was a bunker on the right front of the green.  I took aim at the pin and landed on the left side of the green, short of the flag, setting up a nice birdie attempt.  I missed my birdie putt, but did make my second par in a row.

I approached the final par 3 on the course with some trepidation.  I had made double bogeys on the first three par 3s. Two of the first three had water in play.  The 17th hole had more water than the previous par 3s combined.  It protruded into the lake like a bridge across its southeast corner.  It was also playing as the longest par 3 of the course.  There was certainly a lot to think about as I prepared to hit my tee shot.  My tee shot landed 12 feet short of the flag and to the left.

With my ball, safely on the green of the final par 3 on the course, I took a moment to visit the lone tree that stood in the corn field that became the Crooked Stick Golf Course.  The tree is now a stump that serves as a base for the symbol of the course, a golf club with a crooked stick as the shaft.  There is also a plaque that lists the founding members of the course.  I tipped my hat to them for their contribution to the game of golf.


After visiting the stump, I made my way to the 17th green where my birdie putt awaited. I saw the line on the putt. It looked like it was breaking about 18 inches.  I was so confident that I’d make the birdie, that I asked our caddy Jordan to photograph the putt and make sure he caught the ball dropping into the cup.  What he caught was not a ball dropping into the cup, but rather a ball that move only about 6 inches of what I thought would be an 18 inch break. I made the second putt to record my third par in a row, but was disappointed in not making a birdie.

There we stood on the 18th tee box.  Another hole that was over 400 yards long with water in play. 


The lake that came into play on the par 3 seventeenth hole ran the length of the right side of the tee boxes, fairway, and green on the 18th hole.  I hit my tee shot into the lake.  Mike was kind and said I should re-tee because of my lack of familiarity with the course.  On my second tee shot, I didn’t want to go anywhere near that lake.  I hit my drive to the left and almost put my ball into the backyard of Pete Dye.  He still lives along the 18th fairway at Crooked Stick. 

The hole only got worse from there.  My approach shot flew the green and barely stayed in bound. I then left my third shot on the bunker.  I just picked up and wrote down a double bogey on my card.  It was an unceremonious end to a wonderful day of golf on a historic course with the Hicks brothers and Mike Kilkenny.

I would like to thank Doug for coordinating the round and both Bob and Mike for hosting us.  I’d also like to thank Brian for joining us for the round.  I will always remember that there was a man who found a crooked stick and built a wonderful golf course in its honor.

87,Bayou Oaks City Park,non100,"New Orleans, LA",Rees Jones,2017,"Bayou Oaks City Park (South) (New Orleans, Louisiana)",Brandon Wilde,rev087_bayou_city_1,"The Takeaway:  Bayou golf. The flat terrain is offset by some clever hole designs through the natural vegetation and water hazards. The archaic cypress and mossy oak trees make for some fantastic natural hazards.  Grade B-. What to Expect:  The South Course at Bayou Oaks was a pleasant surprise! This course was devastated by Hurricane Katrina and recently, in 2017, re-opened with a new design done by Mr. Rees Jones. As a city course I had low expectations, but I thoroughly enjoyed this track. The fairways were wide and the bunkers were soft. There were plenty of water hazards, but the course was very playable. The large century-old oak trees with Spanish Moss hanging off the branches give the course a mystical feeling. They are also strategically placed, making them significant hazards that necessitate some low-trajectory and well-shaped shots. The course also has programs that allow inner-city kids to learn the game that we all love so much. That is just one more reason why this course should be on your short list of courses to play in NOLA.
Individual Hole Analysis
Signature Hole:  9th Hole – 585 Yard Par 5 – Its not a terribly long hole, but with a water hazard in front of the tee box and a sand trap about 260 yards out it makes for an intimidating tee shot. A creek runs along the right side of the fairway, daring you to go big, but forcing you to play it safe. Your third shot around the green will give you a beautiful view of Old Glory flying just beyond the green. It’s a fantastic way to finish the front nine.
9th Hole at Bayou Oaks City Park (South) (585 Yard Par 5)
Best Par 3:  2nd Hole – 200 Yards – It doesn’t take long to get to the good stuff at Bayou Oaks. This hole is probably the most memorable of the course. A longish par three with water, sand, and a gorgeous oak guarding the safest entry point into the green. A high draw is the perfect play here to have a chance at a 2. However, there is quite a bit of fairway beyond the oak and in front of the green, so a miss short doesn’t take you out of contention for a par.
2nd Hole at Bayou Oaks City Park (South) (200 Yard Par 3)
Best Par 4:  16th Hole – 347 Yards – Don’t gamble to the left. A large water hazard plays along the entire left side of the fairway collecting all errant balls. Play out to the right, there’s more room there than you think. The smartest play is to play about 250 yards off the tee. That will keep you short of the sand and you’ll have less than 100 yards into the open right front aspect of the green. 16th Hole at Bayou Oaks City Park (South) (347 Yard Par 4)
Best Par 5:  11th Hole – 567 Yards – I’m a sucker for the wayward tree hanging out in the middle of the fairway. It just gives so much character to the golf hole. Again, Mr. Jones uses a large Oak as an obstacle that must be accounted for. The tree will come into play on the second shot and it is near impassable if you have a low-ball flight path. Play the shot nice and high over the tree; or play it safe and leave it to the right. 11th Hole at Bayou Oaks City Park (South) (567 Yard Par 5)
Birdie Time:  12th Hole – 373 Yard Par 4 – Another short par 4, but without the hazards one would normally expect on a hole of this length. There is water left, but there is so much room to the right that its not really in play. Grip it and rip it down the fairway, a 240 yard tee shot will clear the bunkers in the fairway, then nestle your approach nice and tight to the pin and tap in that birdie that you deserve! 12th Hole at Bayou Oaks City Park (South) (373 Yard Par 4)
Bogey Beware:  13th Hole – 471 Yard Par 4 – After the birdie on the previous hole, Bayou Oaks counters with a tester. This unassuming hole is tougher than it seems. With a sweeping dogleg left and water left keep your tee shot middle to right of the fairway. The approach is the difficult shot as the fairway narrows to a bottleneck at the green. Don’t be tempted to attack the pin if it is on the left side of the green. Play to the middle-right of the green. Par is a great score here. 13th Hole at Bayou Oaks City Park (South) (471 Yard Par 4)"
88,Bayou Oaks City Park,non100,"New Orleans, LA",Rees Jones,2017,Golf Course Review: Bayou Oaks at City Park - North Course,Kyle Hrubes,rev088_bayou_city_2,"After setting our schedule of where and when to do Golf Nola's golf course reviews this year I realized I have not done a Golf Nola review of the Bayou Oaks at City Park North Course. I made sure to get that done yesterday (1/4/24). 

This was also a different kind of review for the video. I decided to walk the golf course. Something I may not try again when doing an official Golf Nola review. Even though I think the video came out fine, I do not feel I was able to show as much of the golf course as opposed to when I use a golf cart. 

Outside of playing in scramble events, I have not played a regular stroke play round at Bayou Oaks North Course in several years. I played the golf course plenty as a junior and have fond memories on the golf course. It is actually the first course I ever shot under par on. Although that was back when it was a par 70 and the routing of the back 9-holes was different. It is still the same front 9-holes and it still brings back good memories. 

The North course at one point in time had the lowest green fee in the entire country at a rate of $8 to walk. Times have changed but the rate is still considered low. At only around $22+ tax to walk you can't go out and expect ""tour"" like conditions. However, the golf course is perfect for beginners, golfers who only play a few times a year, and those who either can't afford or don't want to pay more than $50 to play golf. It is also a short enough golf course to enjoy a round while walking at just under 5800 yards. 

As for the conditions, they were not bad based on the rate of the green fee. Actually, the conditions were pretty decent in some aspects. They were not consistent throughout the golf course but at the same time, there was some consistency. Only one green, hole number 9, had more grass on the green than any other. It still had a similar speed like the rest of the golf course but it was greener and had thicker grass on it. Perhaps because it is not as exposed to the colder north winds as much as the rest of the golf course. It also just looked healthier. 

Overall Rating: 2.5 out of 5

Tee Boxes: 2 out of 5

Don't let the 2 fool you into thinking the teeboxes were horrible. For the most part, they were decent with good amounts of grass on them for this time of year. Finding a decent area of grass was only difficult on one par 3. The main reason I give the tee boxes a 2 is that none of them are level. Some are worse than others and it is not just between the markers. The most level tee box was on hole number one. Just about every hole you had to consider a draw or a fade based on the ball being above or below your feet. 

Fairways: 2.5 out of 5

The fairways had a good amount of grass on them. They had some puddles on a few holes and many of the fairways were soft but the ball was not plugging. You didn't get much roll, if any, due to the recent rain but that was not much of an issue as far as playability. It was only an issue if you tried a bump and run shot. If you landed a ball short of the green on a few holes it would dig into the soft turf and not go much further. The biggest issue I had with the fairways was that I felt I was playing some sort of dodge golf. The fairways have a lot of dips in them that are borderline like potholes. If you play the ball down at all times like I do you could find yourself in the center of the fairway and your ball in a 4-inch depression. You can probably tell in the video the humps and bumps I was walking on trying to hold the camera steady. The grass was cut to a good height, even the crabgrass, and if you missed a depression you would have a decent lie. 

Greens: 2.5 out of 5

The speed of the greens was very good. The dormant grass gave them a speed that was quick but not overly quick. They were bumpy but had a good speed. There was a good amount of spike marks and unfixed pitch marks that could add to the bumpiness but sometimes if you caught those you could get a smooth roll. I found even when I fixed everything in my line the greens were just not smooth. Just like the fairways with depressions, it seemed many of the greens also had areas like that. On a much smaller scale but enough to make a difference when putting. Perhaps all the greens need is a day for maintenance to get out there and roll them and smooth them out. Putting was difficult when trying to judge a quick putt that may slow due to imperfections and not being smooth. However, I have played on worse greens and paid a higher green fee before. 

The bunkers were inconsistent. I played out of three total for the round and had three different experiences. One was near perfect, one was like playing out of clay and another was like hitting off of concrete. I know the recent rain could be a reason for the inconsistency. Maybe one didn't dry as fast, or maybe maintenance didn't get to prep them that morning, Plus a few did not have rake around them. 

I look forward to going back in the spring when the grass is fully grown back in and seeing what the conditions are like. Also, it is rumored that Bayou Oaks will be putting lights up on the North Course for night golf this year. Perhaps they will make some improvements to the course as well. Like leveling the tee boxes or getting the bunkers consistent. 

Again, for the rate it was worth it. The Bayou Oaks at City Park -North Course is great for introducing new golfers to the game. The North course can also be a good place for scratch golfers to challenge their game with the smaller greens and a few tight tree-lined holes, it requires some accuracy."
89,Bulle Rock,non100,"Havre De Grace, MD",Pete Dye,1998,"Bulle Rock (Havre De Grace, Maryland)",Bill Satterfield,rev089_bulle_rock_1,"The Takeaway:  Any argument that Bulle Rock isn't the top public course in Maryland is futile. In fact, in a state known for its exclusive private clubs, Bulle Rock stands up strong with even the best tracks in the state. The routing flows well, the holes are memorable, the course is challenging, and the conditioning is plush. All of these factors add up to a course that you shouldn't miss if you are in Baltimore, Philadelphia, or anywhere between.  Grade B+
What to Expect:  Plenty of upper end public courses claim to offer a country club experience for the day, but none delivers on that promise better than Bulle Rock. This northwest Maryland facility boasts multiple dining options, banquet and meeting rooms, and a full locker room staffed by an attendant waiting to serve you. The experience extends to the golf course where you are greeted by staff members at the bag drop, offered a GPS cart or a caddie for the day, directed to the complimentary driving range, and finally are able to go enjoy a course that features great conditioning. While many Pete Dye courses can feel a bit extreme and unorthodox at times, Bulle Rock instead feels like it belongs on the property as Pete let mother nature take a bigger lead in the design and the result was 18 attractive holes that are highly memorable and varied. The routing flows well which gives a nice continuity to the course and appeal to those that choose to walk. Elevation changes, some more severe than others, exist throughout the property which delivers some enjoyable shot making opportunities while not being too taxing on walking patrons. From the back tees the course will offer all of the challenge you want while the front tees do a great job of accommodating shorter hitters that may struggle with forced carries. The fescue lining the fairways can occasionally gobble up your golf ball and the difficulty of the course is significant enough to create some longer rounds, but overall the experience at Bulle Rock is top notch.
Individual Hole Analysis
Signature Hole:  18th Hole – 485 Yard Par 4 – In classic Pete Dye fashion, Bulle Rock goes out with a bang with this impressive par four. Water lines the entire left side of the fairway as players pray their snap hook doesnâ€™t come out to haunt them. A safe shot up the right side of the short grass will leave players with the best angle to the boulder supported green that fades toward the water and creates the most intimidating approach shot of the day. Rated as the most difficult hole on the back nine, the 18th is worthy of that notorious distinction.
18th Hole at Bulle Rock (485 Yard Par 4)
18th Hole at Bulle Rock (485 Yard Par 4)
Best Par 3:  12th Hole – 190 Yards – If you have played many Pete Dye courses then the look of this one-shotter will seem familiar, perhaps no more famously than at Whistling Straits. The hole wraps from left to right around the water with the green maintaining that angle along the hazard as well. When the pin is in the back right, like it was the day I played, then bold shots at the flag have a much more likely chance of finding the water, like mine did. The smart play is towards the back and left side of the green where the putting surface is largest and the most success can be realized. This hole may not be unique among Dye designs, but its effectiveness is what keeps bringing it back time and time again.
12th Hole at Bulle Rock (190 Yard Par 3)
Best Par 4:  13th Hole – 476 Yards – This is a great hole where Pete doesnâ€™t let you cheat it. Players trying to trim off yardage by contesting the right side of the hole where the fairway doglegs will almost surely be denied access to the fairway as their ball is repelled down a neighboring ravine. The entire hole slopes towards the ravine thus forcing the wise player to stay plenty left and deal with the lengthy approach shot into the green. The further left you can place your tee shot the more green depth youâ€™ll have to play with while tee shots to the right will have tons of width to play with but very little depth. The green is surrounded by four bunkers which makes the approach shot intimidating to those that fear the beach. It is worth noting that I pulled my approach shot into the railroad ties left of the green which promptly ricocheted my ball onto the putting surface two inches from the hole for the luckiest kick-in birdie of my life.
13th Hole at Bulle Rock (476 Yard Par 4)
Best Par 5:  2nd Hole – 572 Yards – Many players will walk away from Bulle Rock with this hole being their favorite. Though the yardage is significant, this par five is reachable in two due to how far downhill it plays from the tee. Trees line both sides of the hole and a stream cuts through the fairway about 75 yards from the green which can create some trouble but the pot bunker in front of the green is where you can quickly make a fool of yourself trying to get out. This is likely the most attractive hole on the property and is the first â€˜wowâ€™ moment on the golf course.
2nd Hole at Bulle Rock (572 Yard Par 5)
Birdie Time:  3rd Hole – 177 Yard Par 3 – Clearly the best chance you have of scoring a birdie on any hole is one that you can easily reach in regulation. This short-to-mid length par three has a massive green that is easy to hit and will even welcome tee shots hung out to the right where they can quickly kick back onto the putting surface. The trees on either side of the green will help knock down the wind which combined with a perfect lie on the tee box should equate to an great opportunity to knock your approach shot stiff. Pick up a birdie here so that you have some insurance for later in the round where I assure you that youâ€™ll need it.
3rd Hole at Bulle Rock (177 Yard Par 3)
Bogey Beware:  5th Hole – 483 Yard Par 4 – This is a tough hole . . . a really tough hole. 483 yards is plenty of distance to cover, but you have to do it while the hole doglegs uphill between the trees and around a bunker to an elevated green with a slight false front. Players that think they can clear the bunker on the corner of the dogleg better be able to fly their ball 300+ yards uphill and risk finding the thick rough on the left. The long, skinny green resulted in two players in our foursome three-putting and was a quick reminder of how difficult this hole is from start to finish. Par here easily takes a stroke on the field.

Hole Descriptions: Amongst well-known architects with numerous top courses, Pete Dye is unique in that many of his top designs are available to the general public. I’ve always appreciated this about him and have been fortunate to play a number of his best courses for this reason. Bulle Rock had always been on my radar given its frequent status on Top 100 lists, reputation among Maryland public courses, and the fact that it’s an easy day trip from most Northeastern cities. I finally had the chance to play and certainly came away with an appreciation for the course. While Bulle Rock cannot compete with the likes of Dye’s Whistling Straits, Kiawah, or even Harbour Town due to their settings, it is your typical Dye championship layout, offering an excellent challenge with a strong routing and sterling conditions. The features that immediately stood out to me following my round are the course’s undulating terrain which creates many sidehill lies and its narrow greens, which make for difficult approaches from the wrong side of the fairway. With excellent rates and its history as an LPGA venue, Bulle Rock is arguably the best public option nearest to Philadelphia, Washington D.C., and Baltimore. I highly recommend it.

Pete Dye is sympathetic at the start with a 335 yard slight dogleg left par 4. This hole features a right-to-left sloping fairway lined by a prominent bunker down the right at 225 yards and two down the left at 170 and 230 yards. Driver isn’t needed here and might get you into trouble, as numerous small bunkers guard short of the green on either side. Like many greens at Bulle Rock, this putting surface is narrow and primarily runs right-to-left. This is probably the most boring hole on the course as well as the easiest – don’t lose a shot here.

The par 4 1st
The 2nd is one of Bulle Rock’s signature holes as an excellent 555 yard par 5. With the entire hole in view from an elevated teebox, this hole begins with a severely downhill teeshot to a left-to-right sloping fairway lined by OB right the entire way. I found this teeshot to be visually intimidating, but there’s plenty of room down the left provided you can’t reach a left bunker around 300 yards. The golfer is left an interesting choice on their second shot, with a small creek running through the fairway about 90 yards short of the green. There is some fairway on the other side of this creek, but I don’t see the benefit of aiming for it unless you think you can reach the green. This green is elevated, runs back-to-front, and is guarded by deep bunkers short and right with several small pot bunkers long. Despite it being a par 5, there’s lots of room for disaster here.

The approach at 2
The 3rd hole is Bulle Rock’s first and shortest par 3 at 156 yards. Somewhat reminiscent of some of the par threes at Dye’s Blackwolf Run, this hole is most notable for a large tree that overhangs the right side of the green and blocks a right-to-left shaped shot. Even more danger exists left and long, with a severe drop off, numerous bunkers, and fescue. This excellent green is narrow and plays somewhat like a Redan.

The par 3 3rd
The 4th hole is one of the stronger par fours on the course playing as a 380 yard dogleg right. Featuring a teebox hidden in the back right trees, a power cut is the preferred play off the tee. This entire fairway slopes left-to-right and is guarded by giant bunkers on either side beginning around 225 yards. This approach plays slightly uphill to a narrow, long green defended by bunkers on either side and a creek to the right.

The sleek par 4 4th
At 405 yards, the 5th hole is a very difficult par 4 deserving of its number 1 handicap. A dogleg left playing severely uphill on the approach, this hole begins with a short forced carry over a creek to a generous fairway defended by a large bunker on the left side of the dogleg around 220 yards. Longer hitters need to be wary of a bunker on the other side of the dogleg at about 270 yards. This approach then runs at least one club uphill towards yet another narrow, right-to-left sloping green lined by numerous small bunkers on either side. Par is an excellent score here.
The lengthy par 4 5th
The 5th green
After some difficult holes, the 6th is a fun hole and one of my favorites on the course as a 387 yard par 4. This teeshot plays semi-blind and straight downhill towards a sloping fairway defended by numerous bunkers down the right. A creek marks the end of this fairway at about 310 yards and must be carried to another small, narrow green that runs slightly left-to-right and is defended by a giant bunker right.
The par 4 6th
The approach at 6
At 175 yards, the 7th hole is technically Bulle Rock’s longest par 3 but I think the 12th plays longer most days. This is a nice one-shotter running slightly uphill towards a well-defended green featuring multiple plateaus, four bunkers short right, and a small pot bunker left.
The par 3 7th
The par fives at Bulle Rock are an extremely strong collection and the 481 yard 8th hole is my favorite of the group as a dogleg left beautifully laid out in front of you. Essentially playing as a Cape, fescue lines the entire left side of this hole, forcing golfers to choose their line carefully. Large bunkers down the left at 250 yards and right at 300 yards mark the start of the dogleg. From here, the fairway runs slightly uphill and progressively narrows with thick rough right and numerous bunkers and fescue down the left. This right-to-left sloping green is guarded by two deep bunkers left.
The par 5 8th
The 9th hole is a dramatic and interesting dogleg right par 4 at 418 yards. One of the most difficult holes on the course, this teeshot is extremely intimidating with water directly in front of you and an 170 yard carry to reach the far left portion of fairway. The ideal line takes on this water and requires a carry of at least 220 yards over a trio of bunkers as well. This entire fairway slopes severely left-to-right and makes for a difficult approach to a small green defended by bunkers on either side.
The golfer has numerous (but few appealing) options on the 9th teebox.
Notice a small portion of fairway to the far right longer hitters could perhaps reach
The back 9 is the longer of the two sides at Bulle Rock but begins with an easier hole in the 373 yard par 4 10th. A dogleg left that turns around 270 yards, this hole initially plays straight over a plateau to a fairway lined by numerous bunkers left and fescue to the far right. This green is again narrow and quite undulating defended by bunkers on either side.
The par 4 10th
The approach at 10
At 596 yards (and 665 from the Blacks!), the 11th hole is the longest at Bulle Rock as a true marathon, three-shot par 5. I counted nearly 20 bunkers on this hole alone, the closest thing to Whistling Straits here. This fairway is initially a slight dogleg left guarded by bunkers on either side around 220 yards and fescue to the right. It then runs downhill and narrows considerably with a set of five bunkers down the right about 190 yards short of the green. This green most notable for its right swale is defended by numerous pot bunkers on either side and a large bunker right. Despite getting five shots to work with, a par here is not disappointing.
The par 5 11th
The approach at 11
The 12th hole is arguably Bulle Rock’s signature hole as a 174 yard par 3. A classic Dye template and near carbon copy of Blackwolf Run’s 4th, this hole features water down the right you’ll have to carry the entire way if you want to take a straight line to this green. Three bunkers guard left and must be popular bailouts for those afraid of getting wet. This green contains some tricky pins with multiple plateaus.
The par 3 12th is an awesome hole
A worthy number 2 handicap, the 13th hole is a difficult 428 yard dogleg right par 4. Featuring a tight fairway that turns right around 260 yards, you absolutely cannot miss right here with a large bunker at 160 yards and a valley of rough and OB afterwards. After a good drive, the golfer is left a difficult approach to a small, left-to-right sloping green defended very effectively by deep bunkers short and on either side.
The par 4 13th requires both accuracy and power
The approach at 13
At 331 yards, the 14th is the shortest par 4 at Bulle Rock and offers a chance to get a shot back after some tough holes. A downhill, semi-blind, slight dogleg right, this fairway is generous down the left but features bunkers right the entire way. At about 280 yards, this fairway narrows to essentially nothing with bunkers on either side. This approach plays as much as a club less towards another small, narrow green defended by several bunkers on either side.
The fun par 4 14th
The approach at 14
The 551 yard 15th is the final par 5 on the course and is one of the more interesting holes here. Featuring a split fairway, this teeshot is fairly straightforward and must play down the right to an uphill generous fairway that ends around 260 yards with a bunker down the left as well. From here, the golfer must carry a creek to access the second portion of the fairway to the left. Good teeshots will be rewarded with a possible heroic shot to reach this green in two. This green is extremely long and narrow and runs back-to-front.
The par 5 15th
The second shot at 15 gives the golfer options
The 16th hole plays similarly to the 6th as a 387 yard par 4 running severely downhill. This hole is pretty straightforward with bunkers down the right at 210 and 270 yards and trees left. This green again requires precision, playing very narrow with four bunkers and a mound down the left and a singular bunker right.
The par 4 16th
The 17th is a 160 yard par 3 and is perhaps the easiest hole at Bulle Rock. While not a bad hole, it is rather forgettable and feels somewhat cheap coming so close to the end. Playing level, this hole features a large green with numerous plateaus defended by bunkers on either side.
The par 3 17th
At a strong 459 yards, Bulle Rock saves one of its most memorable holes for last with the par 4 18th. Playing downhill, this tough hole features water down the left the entire way while the right is defended by a bunker at 310 yards and a large tree at 225 yards. This is probably the most intimating approach on the course, with water wrapping around an undulating green left and long and a bunker long right.
The par 4 18th
The approach at 18
A side view of the 18th green and clubhouse
General Comments: Bulle Rock features an upscale clubhouse and excellent practice facilities, with a full grass range and nice short game area near the clubhouse. Pace of play was average when I played. The course is named for the first thoroughbred horse brought to the U.S. from England.
Bulle Rock’s range is better than most private courses
Verdict: While not Pete Dye’s most memorable design, Bulle Rock is an excellent, affordable, and challenging upscale layout that rightfully earns its reputation as one of the top public courses in the region."
91,Tullymore Golf Course,non100,"Standword, MI",Jim Engh,2002,"Tullymore Golf Course (Stanwood, Michigan)",Bill Satterfield,rev091_tullymore_1,"The Takeaway:  One of Jim Engh's higher acclaimed courses, Tullymore boasts Engh's brazen style with muscle bunkers, punchbowl greens, and loads of risk/reward options. The extreme nature of the design would be difficult to enjoy on a daily basis, but is well worth a visit in Michigan.  Grade B-
What to Expect:  Jim Engh is one of those architects you either ""get"" or you don't. He has perhaps the most unique design style in golf which seems to instantly appeal to players or repel them. His individual style certainly caught the attention of raters at Golf Digest that put Tullymore in its Top 100 Golf Courses in America rankings, and even after falling off that list, it held in for over 10 years on the Top 100 Public Courses in America list. When players tee it up at Tullymore there are a few features they will instantly notice; the long squiggly bunkers that Engh refers to as ""muscle"" bunkers, the green sites that are often depressed into a punchbowl with long grass on the face, and the number of forced carries over wetlands. Of those features, it is the greens that provide the most interest and drama throughout the round with a ton of creativity needed to navigate them effectively. The 75.2/150 rating and slope from the tips is a stout test for a course that measures 7250 yards and you'll find that the challenge never lets up from the 1st tee to the 18th green. The back nine is the better of the two sides and the par fives stand as the highlight of the course with great risk/reward opportunities where Jim rewards the bold play more often than the conservative one. It certainly isn't a course you'd walk, so cart golf is the call of the day with a routing that favors dramatic holes more so that continuity in the flow. I don't know if I own enough golf balls to make this my home course, but it is certainly worthy of an annual visit if you reside in the Midwest.
Individual Hole Analysis
Signature Hole:  18th Hole – 535 Yard Par 5 – The 18th at Tullymore reflects so much of what Jim Engh brings to his designs with a hole that is fun to play, features a risk/reward element, and will keep you thinking about strategy from tee to green. The tee shot plays at an angle to the fairway where a pond runs the full length of the left side. A successful tee shot will set up a decision on whether to challenge the green with a second shot that needs to carry water the full length of distance to the green. From this angle, the green is very wide but quite shallow and features a muscle bunker running up the water line before bending in front of the green on a line that will cause havoc for players going for it in two. Laying up to the right on the second shot will be no walk in the park as two trees soar from the edge of the water hazard and can inhibit the line you want to take into the green. Behind the green is a hillside that can be utilized to bail out to, but this is the type of hole where you are presented with challenges and opportunities on each stroke and Jim is going to require commitment from you in order to be successful.
18th Hole at Tullymore Golf Course (535 Yard Par 5)
Best Par 3:  12th Hole – 257 Yards – The 12th is a lengthy one-shotter that plays into a bowled green, which on its own wouldn’t be overly unique, however Engh doesn’t stop there. A hill on the left side blocks the view of the left 3⁄4 of the green and creates a blind shot into many of the pin locations with just the tip of the flag often being in view. Attempting to hit a big cut into the green will require carrying the trees that loom on the left side whereas hitting a draw can be an ideal way to find the opening into the green and utilizing the spin and ground to work tee balls near the flag. It is fun, challenging, perhaps peculiar, and 100% Engh.
12th Hole at Tullymore Golf Course (257 Yard Par 3)
Best Par 4:  10th Hole – 458 Yards – I really enjoyed starting the back nine with a classic risk/reward dogleg right par four. The tee shot plays straight away with a creek meandering along the left side and a lone tree protecting the corner while the right side offers a hill to help keep balls in play. Bailing to the right results in an angle on the approach where the water on the left is a bigger factor while players coming from the left side of the fairway can be more aggressive with their second shot given the room to miss right or long. At this point in the round you should know if you are feeling better about your drives or iron game and can decide which strategy to employ to come out successful.
10th Hole at Tullymore Golf Course (458 Yard Par 4)
Best Par 5:  16th Hole – 608 Yards – The 16th features elements of a classic par five design that Engh is prone to employing, though this hole plays longer than most of its cousins. The tee shot is fairly nondescript as it plays towards a flattish fairway with trees lining each side, but then things start to get interesting with the second shot. The fairway bends to the left around a pond and players are presented with a decision on whether to cut a chunk of yards off by hitting over the marsh on a straight line to the green or whether to lay up on the right side where a series of hillocks line the outside of the short grass. A lengthy muscle bunker winds along the low ground between the water and fairway with its last leg pushing towards the green and sitting on a direct line with player’s shots who try to get home in two. In match play, this is a great hole for players to decide whether to play aggressively or whether to dial back and just make par.
16th Hole at Tullymore Golf Course (608 Yard Par 5)
Birdie Time:  3rd Hole – 317 Yard Par 4 – Perhaps the most unique hole on a course classified by uniqueness, the 3rd is a confounding design that will have you questioning your strategy each loop around, but ultimately, yields an opportunity to card a birdie as well here as anywhere on the course. This short hole features two oversized trees whose branches impede the air over the ideal landing zone of a drive. Laying back short of them will almost certainly require you to try to finagle a shot through them or perhaps over them. Though more times around Tullymore could convince me otherwise, the best strategy appears to require a drive that carries the tree on the left and opens up a great angle to attack the flag from with the green featuring a shallow bowl effect that will work balls towards the center of the putting surface. Of course the best play of all is bombing a drive straight at the green, but the muscle bunker in front can be a deadly spot to be. No matter how you attack this hole, its short length should yield an opportunity to score with and perhaps make up for any failures on the previous hole.
3rd Hole at Tullymore Golf Course (317 Yard Par 4)
Bogey Beware:  2nd Hole – 481 Yard Par 4 – Jim expects you to have warmed up before your tee time because he is going to throw his most difficult test at you with the sophomore hole. At 481 yards and nowhere to cut yardage off, players need to bomb a drive before setting up a lengthy approach into the green that is bowled on the right but falls off on the left. A heavy tree line flanks the left side and will encourage players to hit up the right side, however approaches from the right result in an inferior angle to the green that can make finding it in regulation challenging. Players that carve a drive up the left side will increase their chance of getting to the green in two, but the penalty for missing left is severe. Par or better here should put a giddy-up in your step moving forward.

92,Tullymore Golf Course,non100,"Standword, MI",Jim Engh,2002,Tullymore Golf Club Review – A Return To Tullymore,The Original Golf Blogger,rev092_tullymore_2,"I first published a Tullymore review some seven years ago and thought it was one of the best courses I had played. After playing it again recently, my appreciation for Tullymore has only increased.
Tullymore is a superb test of golf, offering players a wide variety of strategic decisions. On any given hole  players have a number of choices off the tee, and then even more as they approach the green. Architect Jim Engh’s design lets a player find his or her own way (assuming a correct tee selection), without being forced into a particular style of play.
I generally play a conservative game, placing a premium on finding a fairway at whatever distance. On the approach, I leave room for error on the short side, trusting in a ground game, pitching balls at the green and letting them roll toward the hole. Tullymore rewards that style of play. But if you’re of the bomb and gouge mindset, that will play well, too.
Such a design, I have found, is rare. Architects quite understandably favor a particular kind of play (if only subconsciously) and incorporate that into their layouts.  Design bias is why it is possible for two golfers to play a course, and at the end of the day one likes it and the other does not.  A design’s ability to appeal to all sorts of players and styles is rare, and is the difference between a good and a great course.
Tullymore is a great course.
The scenery and setting at Tullymore are beautiful, taking advantage of wood, marsh, meadow and elevation changes. The entire layout looks unforced and natural. My impression is that Engh “found” the holes, rather than “built” them. For example, on the front nine, there are three par threes in a four hole stretch. That’s unusual. Once you see the holes, however, you realize that Engh seized exactly what the land offered. The back nine, on the other hand, has three par fives. Again, the holes fit the landscape perfectly.
Tullymore’s conditioning is top notch. I played just a couple of days before the Tullymore Classic, a Symetra Tour tournament, and was hard pressed to find anything out of place.
Tullymore is a bit out-of-the-way in Canadian Lakes, Michigan. But I think it is worth a trip, especially if you stay overnight in one of the resort’s many rooms, and play the sister course, St. Ives (review here).
For my own part, I can’t wait to get back to Tullymore for another round."
93,Hazeltine National Golf Club,non100,"Chaska, MN",Robert Trent Jones Sr.,1962,Hazeltine National,Bill Satterfield,rev093_hazeltine_1,"The Takeaway:  A course designed with the prime purpose of attracting championship golf, Hazeltine has done just that by hosting virtually every major USGA and PGA event. The course is straightforward in its approach and offers little inspiration from an architectural perspective, except for the top shelf 10th and 16th holes, but rather is one of the stoutest tests in the country.  Grade B+.
What to Expect:  A course with a steep tradition in championship golf, Hazeltine National is the go-to location for the USGA and PGA when it comes to hosting an event in Minnesota. Hazeltine quickly became known across the country when it hosted the U.S. Open just eight years after opening. However, it was more of a rise to infamy than it was a rise to fame as the course took verbal abuse from the players in the 1970 U.S. Open when nearly half the field didn’t break 80 on the first day. Located west of Minneapolis, Hazeltine is located on gently rolling terrain and features a design built to test the best players in golf while boasting over 100 bunkers throughout the routing. Renovated in preparation of the 2016 Ryder Cup, the brilliant white sand in the bunkers is both striking and fantastic to play from. In addition, the conditioning of the course is top notch with firm fairways and beautifully rolling greens that give you exactly what you deserve. While the test at Hazeltine is solid, the architecture lacks creativity with the 10th and 16th holes being the only compelling offerings; but they pack some serious punch and rank as two of the best holes in the state. Players are given the option to ride a cart if they wish but walking is encouraged, especially with the caddie program the club offers in an effort to stay true to the roots of the game. In the end, Hazeltine National is a worthy experience considering its tournament history lacks the compelling architecture to be considered amongst the elite courses in the country.
Individual Hole Analysis
Signature Hole:  16th Hole – 402 Yard Par 4 – Not only is the 16th the signature hole of Hazeltine National, it is arguably the signature hole for all of Minnesota. This two-shotter capes to the right around Hazeltine Lake while an outlet stream carves down the left side. The peninsula green pours fear in the hearts of unconfident golfers but the putting surface opens up to the center of the fairway so there is little reward for challenging the lake on the right too much. There are no bunkers to contend with but there is also very little forgiveness around the green so you have to be spot on with your approach. This is a beautiful hole and one you can score well on if you don’t get too greedy.
16th Hole at Hazeltine National Golf Club (402 Yard Par 4)
Best Par 3:  8th Hole – 166 Yards – The distance shouldn’t be intimidating but the surrounds can be on this intriguing one-shotter. A pond sets the boundary for the front and right sides of the green while two bunkers hug the left and a single bunker blankets the back of this modest sized putting surface. A back right pin is the sucker location while anything on the left half should have you pinseeking.
8th Hole at Hazeltine National Golf Club (166 Yard Par 3)
Best Par 4:  10th Hole – 424 Yards – If the 16th hole didn’t get so much hype, the hole you would always hear about at Hazeltine is the 10th. This bold par four features an unassuming tee shot to a landing area that is only partially in view and is flanked by a trio of bunkers on the left and a single bunker on the right. The fairway then doglegs hard left and plummets 35 feet to a green set against Hazeltine Lake. Every corner of the green is protected with sand or water so the only safe route to the putting surface is through the air or a tumbling shot through the opening in the center of the green. The approach shot on this hole offers the most impressive views at all of Hazeltine.
10th Hole at Hazeltine National Golf Club (424 Yard Par 4)
Best Par 5:  7th Hole – 572 Yards – The double dogleg 7th forms a reverse 'S' shape and gives players a risk/reward proposal to consider. The unassuming tee shot features a pair of fairway bunkers on the left side and asks for a baby cut shot that follows the turn of the short grass. The fairway then travels towards the green with a slight turn back to the left at the end as it terminates at the pond imposing the front of the green. Some fairway is offered on the right side to work a ball in but if you don't play it just right you may end up in one of the three bunkers waiting outside the first cut. Players that can fly the ball to the green or have confidence in hitting the 15 yards strip of fairway leading into the putting surface can take their chances at reaching this green in under regulation and hopefully gaining a stroke back on the field. If you go long there is some recovery room from some longer grass so you definitely want to take the longer club if you are in doubt on which stick to pull.
7th Hole at Hazeltine National Golf Club (572 Yard Par 5)
Birdie Time:  14th Hole – 352 Yard Par 4 – The short 14th is a reprieve from the beating of long holes that Hazeltine is well known for and an opportunity to throw a birdie on the card if you haven't been able to yet. A 30 yard long bunker flanks the right side of the fairway and asks players to layup short of it or take their chances bombing past it where the fairway opens up again. Players hitting past it need to avoid the bunker positioned 35 yards short of the front edge of the green on the left side to set themselves up for a simple pitch into the putting surface. The green is a fairly generous target for a hole this short so go flag hunting here and give yourself a short putt for birdie; you're going to want the insurance heading into the next hole.
14th Hole at Hazeltine National Golf Club (352 Yard Par 4)
Bogey Beware:  15th Hole – 642 Yard Par 5 – Nearly 100 yards different in length between the Blue tees and one set up at the Gold tees, the 15th is a bear when you are tipping it out at Hazeltine. A total of 14 bunkers come into play on this hole; more than double the total number of bunkers on my home course entirely. With nine of the bunkers being found on the left side of the hole one would think that staying to the right would be the safest play, however out of bounds lines the entire right side as this portion of the property abuts a housing development and will cost you stroke and distance if you put it in someone's backyard. This is a long and methodical hole with little opportunity to cut distance off and a small climb to the green at the end of your trek. You may suffer a bogey here, but the view of Hazeltine Lake and the surrounding area from this green may be worth it.

94,Hazeltine National Golf Club,non100,"Chaska, MN",Robert Trent Jones Sr.,1962,Hazeltine National Golf Club – Review and Rating,Bo Sjosten,rev094_hazeltine_2,"When it comes to history it’s hard to top Hazeltine. It has stood host to every important US golf tournament; US Open, PGA Championship, US Senior Open, US Women’s Open, and the US Amateur. And now it will host the Ryder Cup.

The course was designed by Robert Trent Jones Sr. and first opened for play in 1962. Host to several US Open Championships, it sometimes got criticized for being too difficult on windy days, culminating in some changes. The changes were well received, and a slew of major championships followed. The course continues to develop, now under the guidance of Robert Trent Jones’ son, Rees Jones, who has upgraded the course by adding new tees and repositioned some sand traps, all to maintain the challenging nature of the course in light of ever improving golf equipment.

The course follows Robert Trent Jones philosophy; reward brave shots well executed and punish poor ones, while always offering a safe alternative to avoid risk-taking. In other words, tempt the brave to take risks to win tournaments.

Clubhouse
The club house has all you can wish for, and some of it you can even buy, at very reasonable prices, in the proshop. Also don’t miss all the history lining the walls on the way to the restaurant. If you have a chance, try to get up on the rooftop balcony, which offers a great view of the course, with downtown Minneapolis visible in the distance on a clear day.Ryder Cup display in the clubhouse.
So can you play Hazeltine? Not really, it is a private club. But on Mondays it is open for charity and corporate events. So if you work for the right company you may have a chance to get a tee time. If you do, you’re in for a treat.
Already on the first hole, you realize that this is not an easy course.

Even if you make the green in regulation, you’ll be faced by a difficult putt if you’re not on the right level. This continued to be true on many holes, especially the fourth hole.

After some rest on the second hole, the third hole, a par five, had index one. Even the pros need three to reach the green, with a difficult approach to an elevated and very undulated green. One of my personal favorites on the course. At the fifth hole, bunkers are the main complication. On hole six, one of the most beautiful (especially if you live in one of the villas by the green) you get the first taste of water. And so it continues.

On the back nine, you get down to Hazeltine Lake already on the 10th, , the most scenic of all the holes, and you soon reach one of the hardest holes on the course, number twelve. With a new tee 50 yards back and a pond guarding the green, for the pros this is a real challenge.

On the 16th, you drive over Hazeltine Lake. As if that wasn’t difficult enough, if you drive too far you end up in a creek. Johnny Miller called this hole “probably the hardest par four I ever played”. But if you play from one of the more forward tees, it is doable for all players.

The course finishes as it opened, with a three-tiered green, letting the greenkeeper make the hole as difficult as the tournament demands. A great setup."
95,Fallen Oak Golf Club,non100,"Saucier, MS",Tom Fazio,2006,"Fallen Oak Golf Club (Saucier, Mississippi)",Bill Satterfield,rev095_fallen_oak_1,"The Takeaway:  The ""Shadow Creek of the South,"" Fallen Oak is MGM's high roller offering north of the gaming town of Biloxi, Mississippi. While not in the same league architecturally as Fazio's effort with its sister course in Las Vegas, Fallen Oak delivers the same exceptional service and conditioning to create the most envied golf experience in the Magnolia State.  Grade B+
What to Expect:  The high roller golf course of MGM's Beau Rivage Resort and Casino, Fallen Creek is modeled after another Steve Wynn project; Shadow Creek in Las Vegas. Like Shadow Creek, Fallen Oak was designed by Tom Fazio as an oasis removed from the glitzy lights of a gambling town. Both courses offer similar experiences including a limo ride from their respective hotel, personalized name plates in the locker room, celebrity name plates next to yours, immaculate conditioning, caddies, and often more employees on property then there are golfers. Fazio had less to work with on North Las Vegas’ barren desertscape but employed more imagination to create a course that is more compelling to play than Fallen Oak. That isn’t to say Fallen Oak isn’t good, because it clearly is, it just doesn’t live up to the lofty standard of its older brother. Fallen Oak is solid from start to finish, as you’d expect with Fazio, with the front nine offering the more engaging hole designs of the two sides, although the signature 18th is easily the best hole on the entire property and the best finishing hole in the Magnolia State. In fact, the course gets its namesake from this hole where a large oak tree, which is partially fallen, sits on the right side of the driving zone and was commonly used as a meeting spot when Fazio’s crew was constructing the course. The back nine features more movement in the terrain than the front nine but is also routed through denser trees, so getting wild off the tee gets punished quicker. Speaking of tee shots, the bunkering throughout the course is deep and can be a real nemesis off the tee where several bunkers impinge the driving zones. In the end, Fallen Oak clearly offers the best golfing experience in Mississippi which certainly contributes to its lofty rankings on magazine lists, but architecturally it takes the silver medal to the newer Gil Hanse designed Mossy Oak course up in West Point.

Signature Hole:  18th Hole – 493 Yard Par 4 – Quite easily the best hole on the course, the 18th also makes an argument as the most difficult. The course’s namesake comes from the partially fallen oak tree located right of the fairway and can be reached with a long tee shot. Going left off the tee doesn’t provide any safety as a trio of bunkers await on that line and require players to stripe one down the short grass for any hope of reaching the green in regulation. The left side continues to provide a challenge enroute to the green with a pond and large bunker flanking that side of the putting surface while a small bunker sits near the front right. With a non-scoring club in your hand, some players may elect to just layup and take their chances at getting up and down rather than assuming the risk of a lengthy approach which could yield a big number if things don’t go well. The way the hole bends left and swoops down to the green next to the glistening water pair with the artistic bunkering creates a beautiful setting to play golf.
18th Hole at Fallen Oak Golf Club (493 Yard Par 4)
Best Par 3:  3rd Hole – 224 Yards – A crescent par three wrapping to the left around a pond where the further you tee it back, the more carry you have to achieve to clear the water. The green angles away from the player and affords the most forgiveness on the right side, so if you are between clubs and choose to stomp on the shorter club, don’t even think about attacking a flag on the left side. Both par threes on the front (3rd and 8th holes) play over the water so you need to avoid going short at all costs.
3rd Hole at Fallen Oak Golf Club (224 Yard Par 3)
Best Par 4:  10th Hole – 468 Yards – The back nine starts with a very strong two-shotter that will test even the best of players. Large bunkers are found on each side of the driving zone so there is minimal forgiveness afforded off the tee before players find themselves staring at an uphill approach shot. The center of the green is fronted by a bunker and pushes players away from the heart of the putting surface which makes hitting this green in regulation all the more difficult. Reprieve is afforded up the left where the fairway tumbles in from this side and can help move approach shots onto the green. It takes two very good shots to have a look at birdie, so pat yourself on the back if you can manage a par here.
10th Hole at Fallen Oak Golf Club (468 Yard Par 4)
Best Par 5:  13th Hole – 575 Yards – The 13th features a design element that I really like; a dogleg that bends one way while the fairway slopes the opposite direction. In this case, the fairway slowly and steadily bends to left the whole way while the terrain tilts to the right. Bunkers protect left side of the hole in case people try to cheat the distance and attack the dogleg while a pair of bunkers await 75 yards from the green on right side to challenge the layup zone. Getting home in two requires a shot up the left side that fades over to the safe side of putting surface. The uphill approach provides one of the more visually appealling shots on the course as well as challenging given the limited view of the green.
13th Hole at Fallen Oak Golf Club (575 Yard Par 5)
Birdie Time:  7th Hole – 330 Yard Par 4 – Time to get aggressive. Despite the water that flanks the right side of this hole, the 7th delivers an opportunity to score well. If you are on top of your game and can pop a 290 yard tee shot over the fairway bunkers on the right then you will find your ball perched on the front edge of the green with an eagle opportunity awaiting. Two fairway bunkers are found on each side 235 yards from the green where the holes doglegs so whether you play aggressive or conservative off the tee you’ll want to stay short or go long of the sand. Obviously there is more safety left than right, so if you can make a swing that will take the right side out of play then hammer away and make something happen here.
7th Hole at Fallen Oak Golf Club (330 Yard Par 4)
Bogey Beware:  5th Hole – 488 Yard Par 4 – Playing straight south into the prevailing wind, the lengthy 5th can play even longer than the card indicates. Two fairway bunkers sit in the driving zone on left side 275 yards from the back tee box and then a lake picks up where the bunkers left off to protect the rest of the left side all the way to the green. The fairway narrows along the water and a bunker protects the front left of the circular green to provide a difficult approach shot to contend with. With the fairway tilting slightly towards the water, it is easy to have a ball turnover towards the hazard when the ball is pinched without a fading follow through. Be smart here and take the big number out of play.

96,Fallen Oak Golf Club,non100,"Saucier, MS",Tom Fazio,2006,Fallen Oak at the Beau Rivage makes you feel like a member of a private club in Mississippi,Jason Lusk,rev096_fallen_oak_2,"SAUCIER, Miss. – Golf architect Tom Fazio is a heavyweight in the private club world. His designs pepper the Golfweek’s Best list of top private courses across the U.S., with dozens of such facilities among the top modern courses in the country.

Wade Hampton Club in North Carolina, Congaree in South Carolina, Estancia in Arizona — those and more than 50 others rank highly, and they’re all private. His courses tend to be part of clubs that excel in catering to their memberships’ every whim.

Golfweek’s Best Top 50 Casino Courses for 2023
Fazio also has excelled in building courses for another segment of golf: casinos. Fazio either designed or collaborated on seven of the top 50 casino courses in the U.S. Best of all, these highly ranked layouts are open to the public, albeit sometimes only to guests staying at the affiliated casino resort.

Fazio’s Shadow Creek in Las Vegas has topped the Golfweek’s Best rankings of casino courses in the U.S. for years. The over-the-top desert layout in North Las Vegas is a testament to what might be accomplished when money is no issue, and the layout’s $1,000-plus green fee is aligned with that. The amount of play at Shadow Creek is also limited — stay at the MGM, take a limo to the course, be treated like a star.

But there’s another way to experience the best of Fazio casino golf that shouldn’t be missed, and it’s much more attainable.

Fallen Oak
No. 18 at Fallen Oak in Mississippi (Jason Lusk/Golfweek)

Fallen Oak near Biloxi, Mississippi, is a much more natural layout than Shadow Creek. And the course – operated in conjunction with MGM’s Beau Rivage Resort & Casino, a AAA Four Diamond award winner — might offer the best opportunity for public golfers to experience a top Fazio layout and all the first-rate trappings that generally come with it. Fallen Oak is No. 2 on the Golfweek’s Best list of top casino courses in the U.S.

From the gated entrance and long drive past live oaks and ponds to the stately clubhouse, all the way to the personalized lockers and frozen watermelon served at the turn on a hot day, Fallen Oak makes a public-access player feel like a member of an elite club. The service is second to none in the public-access golf world.

Director of golf Mark Powell makes sure of it.

“We want it to feel special, that, ‘Hey, I’m at a great golf course,’ ” said the longtime PGA of America pro who took the helm at Fallen Oak in 2021. “We want to be there every step of the way. We want everyone on staff to know your name.”

Fallen Oak Mississippi
No. 17 at Fallen Oak in Mississippi (Jason Lusk/Golfweek)

Guests of the Beau Rivage gain access to all this on a course that’s never crowded, hosting just 14,000 or so rounds a year. Counting the several weeks a year Fallen Oak is closed for maintenance – a luxury most public-access layouts can’t afford — it works out to about 40 players a day.

Go ahead, stretch out. Enjoy the quiet. It’s rare these days.

Fazio’s layout at Fallen Oak opened in 2006, and for a decade it hosted the PGA Tour Champions event in Mississippi. And unlike the heavily manufactured Shadow Creek, Fallen Oak sits on a tremendous Southern site that seems entirely natural for golf. Aside from its high ranking among casino courses, Fallen Oak is the top-rated public-access course in Mississippi. The green fee tops out at $275 — you could play four rounds at Fallen Oak for not much more than one round at Shadow Creek — and the resort runs stay-and-play specials.

Fallen Oak also is No. 24 on Golfweek’s Best list of all resort courses in the United States, and it comes in at No. 74 on Golfweek’s Best list of top modern courses built since 1960 in the U.S.

Fallen Oak’s rolling terrain is dotted with wetlands and specimen trees, some of which were relocated during construction. Conditioning is top notch, equal to elite private clubs even in the heat of a Mississippi summer. The greens have plenty of motion without ever crossing a line into too-difficult territory.

Best of all: the bunkering.

Many resort courses slash bunkers across their countrysides, threatening players of all levels and distance. Fallen Oak, by contrast, offers restrained bunkering, one well-placed trap often serving the job. Fallen Oak underwent a major bunker renovation in 2014 in which numerous traps were removed, and the remaining bunkers were given a face-lift again in 2022.

Fallen Oak Mississippi
No. 3 at Fallen Oak in Mississippi (Jason Lusk/Golfweek)

Many holes feature only one fairway bunker. No. 2 is a long par 4, and there is just one fairway bunker on the left side – the hole doesn’t need any more protection. It’s similar at Nos. 4 and 9 on the front side. No. 11 has no fairway traps, and the rest of the back nine is similarly restrained. The ground moves enough through the wide corridors to provide challenge without every stray shot splashing into sand.

Same goes around most of the greens. Play a round at Fallen Oak and you’ll face more chips and pitches than bunker splash-outs. The entire layout, since the bunker renovations, shows a lovely level of understatement married to an extremely comfortable Gulf Coast motif. The terrain and the trees, the ponds and the greens are free to shine without too much sand in your face. You can always head to the beach if you want more sand.

“The first re-do they did, I tell ya, I was really impressed,” said Powell, who was working at another Mississippi club at the time. “I had played here before, back in the early days, and that was always kind of a knock on the course, too many bunkers. After the re-do, when I saw the course, I said this is even better. It’s awesome.”

The par-72 layout can be stretched beyond 7,500 yards, but from the proper tees it’s a treat of attempted shotmaking into smooth putting surfaces. Good shots are rewarded, and the roll-offs around several greens require strategic approaches to the proper sides of the hole. There’s not a thoughtless approach on the 510-acre property, and at the same time there’s not one that’s unattainable.

It’s a perfect attribute to the Beau Rivage, which is packed with highly rated dining and other curated experiences besides the golf. A word of advice: Plan your visit during baseball season, and take in a Biloxi Shuckers minor-league game at MGM Park across the street from the casino resort. It’s an intimate ballpark that provides a great break from the gaming tables.

The golf club is open to any guests of the Beau Rivage, with Powell and his staff hosting frequent special events for VIPs of the casino. Put in enough time at the tables and you might be invited to play in a sponsored tournament for casino credit that can run into the thousands of dollars. The club also has a small membership of invited casino regulars, and Powell hosts all kinds of interesting events for them, too.

“We just want to make it fun for everybody,” Powell said. “We’ve got member tournaments, a great club championship, all kinds of games during the week.

“We’re constantly looking to do every little thing we can to improve the guest experience. Sometimes a little thing goes a long way.”

Sound like a public-access private club? That’s the idea, executed perfectly.

The Preserve Mississippi

Fallen Oak isn’t the only Mississippi course to earn a spot in the Golfweek’s Best ranking of U.S. casino courses. There are four others: The Preserve, the Oaks and Azaleas courses at Dancing Rabbit, and Shell Landing. (See the full list starting on page 40.)

The Preserve Golf Club – the highest-ranked of those four – in Vancleave near Biloxi features a design by Jerry Pate that opened in 2006, the same year as Fallen Oak. Routed past several large ponds among stately oaks, the well-manicured layout features fairly wide fairways and tricky green complexes. There’s generally room to bail out away from numerous water hazards, and the layout’s shaping is interesting without ever being overbearing. The 245-acre property is surrounded by a nature preserve, further enhancing its great sense of remoteness.

The best stretch at the par-71 Preserve is probably Nos. 11 and 12, both short par 4s that make a player think. It might be wise to leave the driver in the bag to set up the best angles into each green, but bold players can attack. Both holes offer a great chance at birdie and a real possibility for a score much higher – great fun. 

The peak green fee in spring is listed as $220, but lower costs are available in the shoulder seasons and summer. Stay-and-play packages are available in conjunction with the Palace Casino Resort, a AAA Four Diamond award winner."

Starter: From a golf perspective, big things have been happening in the Missouri Ozarks and the opening of Ozarks National in early November is the most recent. Payne’s Valley, a Tiger Woods design, is scheduled to open in fall 2019 right next door. Bill Coore and Ben Crenshaw have teamed to become one of the most respected architectural teams in the world and any of their creations merits attention. Ozarks National is open for preview play through Dec. 15 and then will close for the winter months.

Play because ...: Though no official announcement has been made, Ozarks National is expected to be one of the courses used in the PGA Tour Champions' Legends of Golf event in April, replacing neighbor Buffalo Ridge Springs. Grand opening festivities at Ozarks National are planned to coincide with the Legends of Golf. Without question, though, this course will be one of the most talked about in 2019.

Takeaway: The course is in a gorgeous setting with beautiful vistas and not much water. It has an unusually diverse collection of holes, and they’ll keep a golfer's attention throughout. Though the course is ready for play, many more things are still to be done. A spacious clubhouse is expected to be ready sometime next spring and a 15-acre practice range, a putting course and two additional practice greens will also be added eventually.

Clubhouse: 9.0 [Note: The current Mountain Top clubhouse, that is part of the Gary Player-designed 13-hole par-3 course, is being used for Ozarks National guests until a new clubhouse is completed in the spring.]
Difficulty: 8.0
Pace of play: 10.0

THE COURSE | Scorecard
Rarely will a par-3 be the No. 2 handicap hole on any course, but this one merits that distinction. This hole will take its place among the best long par-3s in the country. The small, uphill green is protected by a ravine on the left and trees on the right. There’s very little room for error here.

This is a hole to behold, a true short par 4 that’s reachable for all levels of players if they use the proper tee. There are tougher par-4 holes on the layout, but this one perfectly fits what this course is all about — a fun, but still meaningful, challenge that you’ll remember once the round is over.

The course’s No. 1 handicap hole comes right after somewhat of a breather at the par-3 eighth. That dramatic transition may accentuate the difficulty of the longer hole. Still, this winding hole is the longest on the course — definitely a three-shotter."

Ozarks National at Big Cedar Lodge in Branson, Missouri is the most challenging course at the resort.  Demands your full attention on every shot.  Ruggedly beautiful landscape.

Introduction
I was talking to a friend in advance of my recent trip to Big Cedar Lodge, and we got to the topic of golf courses.  “I’ve heard the Coore & Crenshaw course is really good,” he said.  “Yes,” I replied, “and also water is wet and the sky is blue.”

Such is life for the most heralded design team in golf.  Ben Crenshaw and Bill Coore get their choice of the best projects, but they must also deal with sky high expectations.  They can’t make a course that’s merely good, it must be great, and a great course is what they created at Ozarks National.

Check out Big Cedar’s original course, Buffalo Ridge, HERE

Practice Facilities
Ozarks National has the full complement of practice facilities that you’ll need before a challenging round.  There’s a large driving range and a putting green that mirrors those on the course.  My favorite element is the massive short game area, shown above.  There are multiple greens, numerous bunkers, and acres of fairway.  This gives you the opportunity to practice all the testing short game shots you’ll need to save pars at Ozarks National.  I love that the greens are all situated above or below the surrounds, just like on the course.

Customer Service & Amenities
Ozarks National has a full clubhouse of its own stocked with soft goods bearing the ringed pheasant logo.  As with all Big Cedar Lodge properties, the customer service is excellent.

There is a Turn Station at the 10th hole which offers your standard assortment of mid-round snacks.  What’s unusual, in a good way, is that everything (except alcohol) is complimentary.

Finally, there are forecaddies available at Ozarks National.  This is the one course at Big Cedar Lodge where I think having a caddie will impact your round because the design of this course is so nuanced.  Knowing where to aim your tee shots and what hazards to avoid will save you strokes and boost your enjoyment.  



Beauty & Scenery
Ozarks National has a rugged beauty that stands in sharp contrast to what you’ll find throughout most of Big Cedar Lodge.  Where Payne’s Valley [review HERE] is beautiful in a very manicured way, Ozarks National has a more natural aesthetic.

Another thing that sets Ozarks National apart from the other courses at Big Cedar Lodge is that it’s played entirely atop a set of ridges.  Buffalo Ridge and Payne’s Valley play up and down elevation, but Ozarks National remains high throughout the round.  This affects the play, which I’ll discuss later, and it also provides long, gorgeous views of the Ozarks on every hole.

Tee Shots
A quick peek at the scorecard could lead you to underestimate Ozarks National’s length.  Across four sets of tees plus a combo set, it ranges from 5,025 yards to 7,036 yards.  But before you strut to the tips, take a look at the pair of meaty par 3s – 216 and 254 yards – and recognize that this course plays to a par of 71.  The blue tees at 6,510 are plenty of golf for all but the best players.

Similarly, at a glance the fairways at Ozarks National seem pretty generous.  A closer look reveals that the fairways pinch and swell at strategic distances.  If you’re content to lay back, you often have more margin for error.  If you choose to push your drive to the limits, the course will demand superior accuracy.  Ozarks National never takes driver out of your hands, but it does occasionally suggest alternatives.

Adding to the demands of the tee shot is the fact that these fairways will run out a lot.  Because Ozarks National is built on ridges, it drains the fastest and is exposed to the most wind.  This means that it plays the firmest and fastest of any Big Cedar Lodge course.  You can land your tee shot in the fairway then watch helplessly as it runs into trouble.  This is a major reason why forecaddies, or hard-earned local knowledge, are key to scoring well.

Approaches
There are only two cuts at Ozarks National: fairway and the native Buffalo Grass.  The Buffalo Grass is thin and wiry, but it is allowed to be quite tall in spots.  If your drive strays from the fairway, you’re rolling the dice.  You may get a benign lie, you may find your ball tangled in long strands of Buffalo Grass, or you might lose it altogether.  There are certainly situations where you’d rather be in a fairway bunker than tangled in the native grass.  The best solution is to hit all thirteen fairways.



The large, gentle movements of the fairways combined with the firm, fast conditions mean that you won’t have to deal with many difficult stances.  Tee shots tend to collect in low, flat areas, so accurate drives are rewarded.  On the other hand, you can find some very athletically challenging positions in the Buffalo Grass.

Thanks to the conditions, you do have the ability to run the ball into the green, if you choose.  However, because many of the greens are elevated, this is not necessarily the easier route.  The greens at Ozarks National are above average in size, so landing a shot on them isn’t too difficult if you’re playing from the short grass.  That said, the firm conditions I’ve mentioned so many times continue through the greens, so you’ll need to come in high with spin or land short of your target.

Greens & Surrounds
Outside of the Buffalo Grass, there is no rough at Ozarks National.  This means that the surrounds are a short game playground where anything goes.  The grass here is a little fluffier than at Payne’s Valley, but it’s cut tight to allow for putting from anywhere, running chips, or flop shots, if you have the nerve.

The primary challenge in the short game is that most of the greens are elevated.  This means that your bunker shots and pitches will need to rise quickly then check.  The ground game is an option, but only if you leave your ball in the correct locations.  Even then, correctly judging pace is no easy task.

Once you get your ball onto the putting surface, the vast majority of your work is done.  The greens at Ozarks National are pretty tame, favoring gentle movements to sharp undulations, tiers, or ridges.  These greens will keep every match tense to the last.  Even if you miss a GIR, any pitch onto the green is likely to have a reasonable chance of saving par.

Overall Design
From the aesthetics to the strategy, Ozarks National is the mirror image of Payne’s Valley.  Where Tiger’s course packs the challenge into the greens, Ozarks National demands more of your ball striking.  I would also say that there’s more to take in from a design and strategy standpoint at Ozarks National.  I heard this course referred to as “PhD-level golf,” which is a term I’ll certainly be appropriating for future use.

It’s also worth noting that Ozarks National is the most walkable full length course at Big Cedar Lodge.  The green to tee distances are minimal, and there aren’t many dramatic elevation changes.  Walking the course gives you a great chance to appreciate the movement of the land and the subtle design elements.



Favorite Holes
#5 – Par 4 – 352 Yards

At 352 yards from the tips, this might not seem like a drivable par 4, but it plays downhill and will definitely tempt you to go for it.  The trees to the left of the fairway will make the conservative player reach for a mid-iron.  No matter how you play it, you’ll want to try it again.

#17 – Par 3 – 144 Yards

The scorecard would lead you to believe that this short par 3 is meant to ease you into the end of the round.  While it isn’t long, there’s nothing easy about it.  You have very little margin for error left or right, and the bunker shots that will follow an errant approach are extremely challenging.

Conclusion
Coore & Crenshaw have designed some of the best golf courses in the world, and Ozarks National deserves to be considered among them.  This is a beautiful, engaging course that you’ll want to play again as soon as you walk off the 18th.  To me, that’s the surest sign of a great course."

In this section, I will describe each hole at The Wilderness Club. I will give you my opinion on how you should play the hole and my thoughts on each hole. Remember, these are only my opinions based upon my background and experience in the golf world. Feel free to comment below with your own opinions! If you would like to know more about my background, read this.


Scorecard
#1 PAR 4

#1 Tee
The opening hole at The Wilderness Club is a slight dogleg to the left. This hole is a good preview of what is to come, driving over tall grassy areas and many well placed bunkers to catch any errant shots. A good drive on this hole will be down the left side of the fairway. There is a large bunker complex on the right side of the green so an approach from the left side will take these bunkers out of play. There is a large bunker behind the green on the left as well.

Wilderness Club #1 Green
#1 Green
#2 PAR 4

#2 Tee
Number 2 at Wilderness will require length and accuracy off of the tee. Another dogleg left, you will need to decide how much bunker you want to carry off of the tee. If you aim for the left side of the bunker on the opposite side of the fairway, you will be in a good position for your approach. There is a large bunker complex left of this green which can make a back left pin placement very difficult.

Wilderness Club #2 Green
#2 Green
#3 PAR 5

#3 Tee
The third hole is a Par 5 that moves right as you approach the green. There is a wide landing area for your drive, but keeping it on the left-center of the fairway will give you a better view of where you want to hit your second shot.


#3 Landing Area
There is a large bunker down the right side and in front of this green, so staying on the left side again on your second shot is best. There are another 2 bunkers along the front left of this green. The green is very long from front to back so choose your approach iron carefully to avoid a monster putt.

Wilderness Club #3 Green
#3 Green
#4 PAR 4

#4 Tee
Another accurate drive is needed on this Par 4. This dogleg left is protected by a bunker on the left corner. Anything hit too far right will drop down into a low area and trees. A perfect drive is just to the right of the fairway bunker.

Wilderness Club #4 Green
#4 Green
As you approach this green, be careful of the pin placement. The green has a lower tier on the back right.


#4 Green Tier
#5 PAR 3

#5 Tee
The first Par 3 at The Wilderness Club is #5. This hole is all about choosing the right club to carry the pond and the bunker in front of the green. There is room to the right if you need to bail out.

#6 PAR 4

#6 Tee
Similar to the 2nd hole tee shot, this hole will make you decide how much of the waste bunker you want to carry. There is room to the right, but if you want a shorter approach to this green, you need to hit a long drive over the bunker. If you are on the right side of the fairway, your approach shot will be straight into this green that is protected on the right and left by more bunkers.

Wilderness Club #6 Green
#6 Green
#7 PAR 3

#7 Tee
This longer Par 3 will test your nerve with a back right pin placement. It is all carry over bunkers to get to the back of this green. There is room to bail on the left. Short and right is big trouble!

#8 PAR 5

#8 Tee
Another intimidating looking tee shot, aim for the left edge of the first fairway bunker. The fairway opens up for your 2nd shot and you should try to keep it down the left side for the best approach.


#8 Landing Area
On the right side of this green, there is a large bunker complex. There are also bunkers on the left. This green has 2 tiers, front and back so choose the proper iron for your approach.

Wilderness Club #8 Green
#8 Green
#9 PAR 4

#9 Tee
The ninth hole is rated as the toughest on the course. If you do not hit a good drive here, you will have a very tough time getting a par. A good drive will be down the left-center of the fairway. The hole drops off past the landing area and there is tall grass on the hillside between the fairway and the green. There is a large bunker complex on the left side of this green and more bunkers behind. This is one of the best looking approach shots you will have in Montana!

Wilderness Club #9 Green
#9 Green
#10 PAR 4

#10 Tee
The back nine starts out with a short Par 4. A driver will be too much club for most people here. The best drive will be a long iron just to the left of the big tree in the fairway. There is a pond on the left side and in front of the green. The green is long and narrow and a back-left pin placement will be the most challenging approach.

Wilderness Club #10 Green
#10 Green
#11 PAR 4

#11 Tee
A drive down the left side of this fairway will put you in a good position for your approach into this dogleg right Par 4. Fairway bunkers and trees cause problems on the right. There is a large bunker complex on the front left of this green. There is some room on the right of this green.

Wilderness Club #11 Green
#11 Green
#12 PAR 5

#12 Tee
This Par 5 does not look like much from the tee. Hit your drive down the left side of the fairway and then grab your camera. From the landing area, you will be looking at one of the best golf green settings in the country.


#12 Landing Area
The second shot should be hit down the right side of the fairway in order to take the pond out of play. The green has sand along the left side and a couple of bunkers behind.

Wilderness Club #12 Green
#12 Green
#13 PAR 3

#13 Tee
Ranked as the easiest hole at Wilderness, this Par 3 requires an uphill shot to a large green. There is a bunker complex front right and plenty of room on the left side.

#14 PAR 4

#14 Tee
This long, dogleg right Par 4, requires a long drive down the left side. There are trees and tall grass on the right side. From the left side of the fairway, you will have a straight shot into this green. There are bunkers on the right side of the green.

Wilderness Club #14 Green
#14 Green
#15 PAR 4

#15 Tee
Another longer Par 4, try to keep your drive down the left side of the fairway. There is a large bunker that runs all the way down the right side of this green. The green is long from front to back so choose your approach iron carefully.

Wilderness Club #15 Green
#15 Green
#16 PAR 4

#16 Tee
This hole is ranked as the 2nd hardest on the course. I would argue that it is the hardest! Unless you can hit a big draw off of the tee, you will be left with a long shot into this green that is surrounded by trouble. There is a pond on the left, long grass and bunkers surround this green. It takes a perfect shot to hit this green in regulation.

Wilderness Club #16 Green
#16 Green
#17 PAR 3

This Par 3 looks pretty straight forward until you reach the green. There is a lower-tier that runs along the right side of the green. As you can see, missing left is big trouble.

#18 PAR 5

#18 Tee
A great finishing hole, this Par 5 requires a carry over natural area off of the tee. The hole bends left around a lake that runs the entire length of the hole.

#18 Landing Area
If you keep your first 2 shots down the right center of the fairway, you will have the best approach into this green. There is a large bunker on the left side of the green and everything, including the green surface, slopes towards the lake.

WILDERNESS CLUB CONDITIONS & REVIEW
The Wilderness Club has been ranked by several publications as one of the best courses in Montana. I would have to agree. The course is in great condition and the greens were rolling at a 10 on the Stimpmeter. This is a championship-caliber course and would prove to be very difficult for a beginner. There are many tee shots where a long carry over natural areas or waste bunkers is required. Every hole is heavily bunkered and the greens are fast and undulated. This course is difficult for even the best players. It is one of the most beautiful courses that I have played so far, so enjoy the surroundings if your game is letting you down!

Pro Shop
The Pro Shop at The Wilderness Club is not very large and can get crowded when people are checking in. They have men’s and women’s golf attire, and golf accessories for sale. They also sell yardage books which will help any first-time players. Lessons are available from a PGA Teaching Professional.
