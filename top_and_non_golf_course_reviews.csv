1,Pine Valley,top100,"Pine Valley, NJ",George Crump / Harry S. Colt,1918,PINE VALLEY GOLF CLUB - 19 POINTS,David Jones,rev01_pine_valley_1,"There’s not much point trying to do a hole-by-hole guide to Pine Valley since others have done a much better job than I could do, for example, the majestic flyover from Golf Digest a couple of years ago. Drone photography can often flatter a golf course - but not in this case. While it’s a great piece of work, I’m still not sure it quite does justice to the real thing.

So, instead of trying to do a course guide, I have some observations on what it is like to play the course as a pretty average golfer (I’m a 12 handicapper) and then a few tips about what to expect more generally if you find yourself with a tee time.

The fairways are much wider than they look...
Every single drive has a forced carry and you can rarely see the landing area. That’s really quite intimidating! However, I hit a pretty average length - usually driving about 230 yards - and from the men’s tees I was able to carry them all without any real issues. When you get over the carry (which normally includes a lot of sand) you will normally find a generous fairway which you just couldn’t see from the tee. A few times we hit what felt like pretty significant hooks or slices only to find the ball safely on the short stuff, no problem.

This meant that the second time we played (lucky I know!) it was far less intimidating from the tee box as we knew what was coming.
The 18th at Pine Valley is wide enough seen from above, but you can’t see the width of the fairway from the tee

 …however, the approaches are devilish
Pretty much half of your approaches will require a carry to the green with anything short being punished, at times brutally. When you combine that with the significant elevation change, you will often find this makes for a very tough second-shot course. So you really need to listen to your caddie and commit to the shots. When I did that, I tended to find I would get over the trouble. Anything less than 100% and you are in for problems. Also, there is no disgrace in laying up to the par 4s and going in with a wedge in three rather than trying to be an unlikely hero from a distance.
Some spots in the sand can be tricky to get out of!

Sand, sand, everywhere - and always a bugger to get out of
When you do come up short you will, more often than not, find your ball in the sand. I say sand rather than bunker as it is more like a waste area and certainly doesn’t play like a traditional bunker,

The lies are often very tight, indeed sometimes - like at the ‘Devil’s Asshole’ bunker on the 10th - there is just no sand in it at all. This takes a lot of getting used and I suspect for some you never do. You will find all manner of challenges - sometimes in a hard baked trench, sometimes against a cliff face with no possibility of a shot. You can take many, many shots trying to get out and the ruling allowing you to take a drop out of a bunker for a 2 shot penalty could be a valuable one to remember. I can only imagine how it must be to play in a medal, with a card in your hand. Terrifying!

The greens are often massive, and always wicked
So you’ve made the green in regulation having hit the wide fairway and nailed your approach. All is good, right? Alas, no. These greens are often vast and there is a lot of movement, so getting down in 2 is often a challenge beyond anyone but the very best putter. Again, listen to your caddie and make sure you ask for reads on all putts. Even the shortest can move hard.

Always take your punishment
While the fairways are wide, it is unlikely you are going to hit them all (although the 75 year old member I played with only missed one in two rounds!). Pine Valley shares some characteristics with the Australian Sandbelt and there is very little rough on the course. The trees which frame many holes don’t come into play too much either. If you miss a fairway you are likely to go straight into the sand or scrub and find yourself often with a very wonky stance or gnarly lie. You will soon learn not to be greedy, not to try and be a hero, but just to put it back on the short stuff. I know that’s advice you will get on most courses but believe me, it is essential here.
The par 3 fifth at Pine Valley - just another amazing hole!

Two rounds are definitely better than 1!
I was lucky enough to play the course twice on the same trip and that really helped to elevate my enjoyment. The first time I was a little tight and intimidated, the next morning I had a much better idea of what was going on and scored pretty well. 31 points off the members’ tees was as much as I could have possibly hoped for, and while I left a few out there, I managed my way around the course pretty well knowing what I could and couldn’t do.

 It really is a thing of beauty
The course is a truly special place. Visually, it is stunning with the colours of the trees, sand and grasses making it look like a magnificent painting. Most holes are self contained, you don’t see others playing as you walk around, and there is no traffic to speak of. It is an incredibly peaceful and tranquil place. 

I hope that helps should you find yourself getting the call to play the course. However, Pine Valley is about more than just the course. 

TOUR TIPS
The entrance to Pine Valley
So, the invite has come and you are all set for Pine Valley. What’s the on-property etiquette and how expensive is the wine I hear you ask? Fear not, read on…

Getting to Pine Valley
You’ve probably read a little about the arrival at the property. Apparently it used to be quite a feat finding the little turn off for Pine Valley but Google Maps has changed all that. Still, it is fun turning past the Clementon Amusement  Park, through a very ordinary looking conurbation, but safe in the knowledge you are just minutes away from possibly the finest golf course in the world!

On arrival, staff at the guardhouse will check that you are on the list and your member is awaiting you. It’s all very discreet but it’s quite clear, if you’re not on the list, you’re not getting in. Pine Valley is large property, so savour the drive in. And to whet the appetite, you’ll actually cross the 18th hole as you reach the clubhouse.

Accommodation at Pine Valley
Hopefully your invite to play at Pine Valley will come with a request to stay the night on the property too. You can only play the course if you are accompanied by a member. The only exception to this is if your member is too infirm to play but has maintained his membership. Either way, your member needs to be on site at all times. Not only that, but expect him to stay close by your side. It’s all done in a very friendly way, but it’s not an accident when he meets you outside your room in the morning not in the breakfast hall!

There are three main types of accommodation at Pine Valley. Firstly, the lodge, which is just next to the clubhouse with one side looking over the fourth fairway and green and the other side facing up the par 3 fifth. The lodge comprises a couple of dozen bedrooms – each with a double bed, cable TV and comfortable shower. The rooms are probably a solid four star hotel standard, so a step up from some on site golf accommodation. The showers were very good, the beds comfy and you could leave your shoes outside your door to be cleaned overnight! Oh, and there are no locks on the doors here, inside or out. They’re a very trusting lot at Pine Valley!

Next door is the dormitory. Accommodation is a little more basic here, including communal showers. Still, if that is the price to pay to be a minute’s walk from the first tee at Pine Valley then so be it!

Members also use many of the private houses scattered all over this vast property so you may well find yourself staying the night tucked behind any green or tee, which would be a pretty nice view to wake up to.

Learn the secret code
There is clearly an etiquette here that members introduce themselves to anyone that they see. The secret to knowing whether you’re talking to a member or another guest is that members will have the Pine Valley logo on their hat/shirt/top without the words ‘Pine Valley’. This ‘no script’ apparel marks them out as one of the chosen ones. Be prepared to do a lot of smiling and introducing!

The clubhouse
The clubhouse itself at Pine Valley is a modest affair. Think antiquated charm rather than modern bling! The locker rooms are functional rather than fancy and the bar is short but well stocked. The vibe is that this is a club for proper golfers. There’s no Country Club atmosphere here – people are here for the golf.

While the main purpose of the clubhouse is functional, there are displays of hickories from days gone by, including several Tom Morris clubs, as well as many fine portraits and trophies adorning the walls so do make sure you get some time to dwell and take it all in.

Eating at Pine Valley
The restaurant is neither large nor overly formal, but the staff will make you feel very welcome and there’s no need to stand on ceremony. For lunch we had the turtle snapper soup and a sandwich – a Pine Valley classic. The sherry was passed around to put in the soup and it was actually very pleasant. You’re fine with soft spikes in the clubhouse and everyone is in golf gear during the day. No Muirfield-style dressing for lunch here.

Dress in the evening time is smarter, the members will have their green jackets on and it’s blazers, ties and slacks all round. We were there in September and the place was jumping. In fact I heard one of the members saying that it was proving hard to get another time in that season, so busy was the course and accommodation. The food is good quality - don’t expect quite Michelin fare and you’ll be fine - and the wine list is extensive but reasonably priced.

This isn’t a place where you should expect a lock-in until the early hours (although I’m sure it happens occasionally!). By 10:30pm it was thinning out and most were off to their beds.

Breakfast the next morning was good too - plenty of fruit, cereal, possibly the best bacon I’ve ever had and an egg station. All excellent!

Hitting the range
The driving range at Pine Valley is one of the very best around, as you’d imagine. It’s a little way from the clubhouse and first tee so you’ll probably get a lift from one of the staff who will arrange a time to come and get you back too. There are plenty of Pro V1s and you’ll be hitting to greens with precise yardages from every hitting spot – you don’t see that every day. There’s also a good short game area. For putting, there’s a green right next to the 18th green and 1st tee box. Plenty of time to build up the anticipation before hitting what may be the most nerve-wracking first drive of your life (oh, and no mulligans!!)

The scorecard at the short course at Pine Valley

Time for 10 more?
While there’s no doubt that Pine Valley is a mentally and physically demanding course, it would be a real shame to play here and not visit the 10-hole Tom Fazio creation that opened in 1992. 8 of the 10 holes are exact replicas of approach shots you will find on the course (at 2, 3, 10, 13, 14, 15, 17, 18) and there are a further 2 original creations. The hitting area on the holes will be moved anywhere between 327 and 86 yards so you get a good test of different approaches. When we played they seemed mainly to be over 170 yards, so it was no push over. In fact, without the caddies and the vegetation grown up a bit more, the balls were actually harder to find. Amazingly the holes really do look and feel like the originals – the elevation change is the same, as is the direction, so you get a really authentic experience.

The pro shop
OK, so that’s all well and good, but we know what you’re really here for. It’s all about the swag of course. You will be glad to know there is a very well stocked pro shop in the clubhouse. I was slightly nervous here since I didn’t want to look like a Bag-Tag-Barry but equally I was keen not to let this moment pass without a few memories for me. And my friends. And my family. And anyone else who knows me.

Rather intimidatingly there are no prices on anything so you need to use some care as you are piling up your purchases but the costs aren’t any higher than you would expect to see at any other shop of its ilk. Also, unlike at some private clubs in the US you don’t have to put these purchases on your host’s account - they will happily take your credit card. I suspect they have seen it all here, so don’t be shy about buying all you want!

But what about the Bag Tag?
Every guest is given a bag tag that one of the guys there will attach to your bag with a set of pliers. I am in two minds about whether it’s a nice touch or a bit ‘show-offy’ move, but the tag is still on my bag while I decide!
Pine Valley Bag Tag
So there you have it, the whole experience at Pine Valley is tremendous and I hope this has given you a little taste of what to expect if you get the invite! As for where else to play if you’re in the area, it would clearly be worth the trip just to play Pine Valley but the perfect doubler would be Merion, just an hour away. My only advice would be try to play Merion first so you can save the best until last!"

Colt,1918,"Pine Valley Golf Club (Clementon, New Jersey)",Bill Satterfield,rev02_pine_valley_2,"What to Expect:  Pine Valley is the finest golf course on the planet. It holds the royal flush of attributes: variety, memorability, tradition, difficulty, and pristine conditions. Plenty of courses want to claim they have 18 signature holes, but Pine Valley can make a stronger argument for that title than any other course in the world. It is hard to imagine that a course of Pine Valley's caliber could be better than it is hyped up to be; but it is. Our friend and host, a longtime Pine Valley member, had this to say, ""Pine Valley is underrated as the #1 course in the world."" Pine Valley is so good it is in a league of its own. The walking-only course is set on nearly 200 acres of sandy terrain that features tons of pine trees and marvelous elevation changes. Though often classified as a penal course, the fairway widths are quite generous and the green complexes are spectacular. Identifying the best hole on the course is like trying to pick your favorite child; it is nearly impossible because they are all so good for different reasons. The world class driving range, about a mile from the clubhouse, features precise yardages from each bag stand to each flag in the field so there is no excuses for not being ""dialed in"" before your round. Lastly, the caddies are all dressed in white, which is a further indication that Pine Valley may actually be heaven on earth!

Individual Hole Analysis
Signature Hole:  Honestly, how can you just pick one?! In fact, it might be easier to try and identify a hole that wouldn't be considered the signature hole . . . maybe. Never has this category seemed so futile then when trying to write a review on Pine Valley. Pine Valley really deserves a hole-by-hole review, but since that isn't the format I use I'll simply include photos of a couple of the holes I loved that aren't featured in the rest of the review.

Best Par 3:  5th Hole – 238 Yards – Ranked in 1999 among Golf Digest's 99 Greatest Holes in America, the 5th hole at Pine Valley is one of the finest and most difficult one-shotters you'll come across. The tee box to the fifth hole rests behind the clubhouse and travels a totally different direction than the previous par three. Playing uphill from tee to green, your tee shot must carry a water hazard just beyond the tee box before also needing to carry the cross bunker. Most tee shots will come up short and find a portion of the fairway resting in front of the green while tee shots that leak right will find themselves in a deep bunker pinned up next to the trees. This is a very heroic hole where pars should be celebrated like birdies!

5th Hole at Pine Valley Golf Club (238 Yard Par 3)

Best Par 4:  13th Hole – 486 Yards – Bobby Jones referenced this hole as the greatest par four in the world, and I'm not going to argue. It only ranked behind the 8th at Pebble Beach and 17th at Cypress Point on Golf Digest's list of greatest par 4s in America. The tee box to this hole is tucked back into the tree and affords the golfer only a slivers view of the uphill fairway. After placing your tee shot in the fairway, the golfer is treated to a view of the green and watches the hole unfold as the fairway bottlenecks and then turns left before widening and pushing back the deep waste areas running along the fairway edges. From most tee shots, the straightest line to the green requires challenging the bunkers up the left side of the hole while a large landing area to the right is afforded to golfers not feeling quite as bold. The 13th at Pine Valley is a wonderful challenge that delivers options and excitement every loop you make.

13th Hole at Pine Valley Golf Club (486 Yard Par 4)

Best Par 5:  15th Hole – 615 Yards – After completing two exceptional holes in the par four 13th and par three 14th, the golfer is handed a treat with the par five 15th which is one of only two such par rated holes on the course. While at some courses the par fives are looked at as a chance to feel some reprieve and score low, it is quite the opposite at Pine Valley. The 15th hole demands a tee shot that will carry the large water hazard off the tee before coming to rest on the left-to-right sloping fairway. Plenty of fairway width is afforded to the golfer initially, but closes down and runs uphill more and more as the green is approached. At 615 yards the hole is long by anyone's standard, but the steady climb uphill makes the hole feel and play even longer and can mentally overcome a golfer that isn't prepared for the challenge. It is a wonderful hole and a fitting challenge for a course of Pine Valley's caliber.

15th Hole at Pine Valley Golf Club (615 Yard Par 5)

Birdie Time:  10th Hole – 161 Yard Par 3 – The shortest hole on the course isn't short on accolades or impressive features; however it does deliver the best opportunity to score a birdie. The green creates an inland island surrounded by sand and hosts one of the smaller putting surface at the course. The distance is such that dead aim can be taken at most pin locations, but properly guiding your ball into the hole on the sloped putting surface is where the real challenge lies here. With so many challenges at Pine Valley, this is your chance to try and take a stroke back from old man par.

10th Hole at Pine Valley Golf Club (161 Yard Par 3)
Bogey Beware:  7th Hole – 636 Yard Par 5 – The 7th hole boasts one of the largest and most famous interior hazards in all of golf; the notorious Hell's Half Acre bunker. Spanning the entire width of the fairway, the bunker contains natural foliage and runs nearly 100 yards in length, epitomizing Sahara style bunkering. At 636 yards, bogey is already something most golfers will have to concede a bogey on. But with Hell's Half Acre bunker in the middle of the hole, tee balls that don't find the fairway will be forced to punch out short of the bunker before proceeding over. For those not willing to let Hell's Half Acre intimidate them, there is the option of taking your chances on what kind of lie you will get in the heavily travelled sand, but scores rarely finish low with that strategy. Even though this hole encompasses the flattest terrain on the property, there are a myriad of challenges awaiting the golfer that can't hit the ball high and straight."

I had an early morning tee time at Cypress Point, and the solitary drive down from San Francisco allowed plenty of time to reflect on the upcoming round. I purposefully drove the scenic California Highway 1 all the way down to coast early that morning, and anticipation for the round peaked as I pulled onto the famous 17 Mile Drive.
DSC00792I pulled past the often photographed “Cypress Point Club – Members Only” signs and walked into the pro shop both nervous and incredibly excited for my round of golf. The club’s professional staff immediately greeted me, and made me feel like I was at my home club. The head pro talked to me as if I was an old friend, offering a tour of the locker room and his assistant chatted with me at length about having lived in St Andrews. Their hospitality made me feel very welcome and added a great element to the experience. I was introduced to my caddie for the day, Marty, a 78 year old who had spent over 25 years at the club, and we set off on a brisk Monterey Peninsula morning!


As I do with nearly all rounds, I read as much as possible about Cypress Point Club before making the journey out to California. On the flight from North Carolina, I combed through Geoff Shackleford’s, Alister Mackenzie’s Cypress Point Club. Two people played the main roles in creating Cypress Point. The first person is Samuel Morse, who was the main developer for much of the Monterey Peninsula area, including Pebble Beach Golf Links. Morse hired the second major name, Marion Hollins, who recruited members, personally hired Alister MacKenzie, and oversaw much of the course construction. She was an excellent player in her own right, and it was her eye for detail and quality that took Cypress to the next level. Both founders had the vision and business knowledge to conceive and build one of the best golf courses in the world. Additionally, the club was built and created during a time when most were failing, the Great Depression. The first round of golf was played at Cypress Point in August, 1928.

Whenever I play a particularly good golf course, I look back on the round and try to encapsulate in my mind what made it a particularly great design. In a number of cases, such as Pine Valley, it is difficult to pick out a single weak hole. That was the case at Cypress Point. It was certainly one of the best and most picturesque settings I have ever had for a round of golf, but the strength of the design was never compromised for the view. 

Hole #1 – 420 yards
The opening hole plays to a wide fairway with a group of fairway bunkers on the left. The approach, seen in the photo above, plays uphill to a large green. 

Hole #2 – 549 yards
The second hole requires a carry to reach the fairway, which works left towards the green. Longer hitters can cut off more of the fairway, leaving a shorter second shot into this fairly long par 5. Beautiful homes line the second fairway, nearly all of which are owned by Cypress Point members.

Hole #3 – 156 yards
 DSC00774 Five bunkers guard this par 3, which provides a visually intimidating view from the tee box. MacKenzie had a theory of making holes appear more difficult than they actually were, and the 3rd is a great example.

Hole #4 – 383 yards

MacKenzie played visual tricks from this tee box. It looks like a sea of bunkers directly in the landing area, and the temptation is to try and “thread the needle” down the left side of the fairway. Thanks to my sage caddie, Marty, I knew there was plenty of room  in the landing area, and took my tee ball directly at the right fairway bunkers. A caddie was crucial during this round.

Hole #5 – 491 yards

The 5th is another bunkering masterclass. The bunkers on the right side of the fairway were not in range for me from the tips, but longer hitters, or forward tees, may bring them into play. Layups need to stay about 80-100 yards short of the green to avoid bunkers and leave a wedge into a two tiered sloping putting surface.

Hole #6 – 521 yards

The second of these back-to-back par 5s is reachable with the correct tee shot. A draw off the left hand side of the right fairway bunkers leaves a lengthy, but reachable, second shot into the green.

Hole #7 – 170 yards

I took an extra club on this beautiful par 3. An area left of the green allows for shots to kick right onto the putting surface. The pin was tucked in the right corner during my round.

Hole #8 – 369 yards

The 8th is the only blind tee shot at Cypress Point. A solid shot just right of the lone tree cuts the corner perfectly. Bolder players can cut off more or less depending on wind and bravery. A gargantuan dune swallows up any balls falling short of the fairway. A pair of deer followed us within 30 feet for the entirety of this hole.

Hole #9 – 289 yards

This short par 4 is drivable for longer hitters. My trusty caddie had taken Phil Mickelson for a loop at Cypress, and Phil hit his “Phrankenwood” 3-wood to 11 feet. The green is very shallow, sloping, and long as seen in the photo above taken from the back left corner of the putting surface.

Hole #11 – 440 yards

The drive on number 11 is straightforward, and in hindsight I should not have hit my driver. You may be able to spot my ball barely short of the right hand cross bunker. The bunkering on this hole creates a stunning view with a chute all the way to the green. The dune behind the green frames the hole nicely.

Hole #13 – 366 yards

Marty turned to me on the tee at 13 and said, “This is a birdie hole.” I didn’t even want to play this hole… I wanted to sit down on the tee box and enjoy the view for the rest of the day! The pin was in a receptive position on this sloping green, and I barely missed my birdie putt.

Hole #15 – 135 yards

The 15th is one of my favorite short par 3s that I have ever played. The 135 yard tee shot is directly over the Pacific Ocean. A pod of seals made plenty of noise as my adrenaline pumped during this tee shot. I like to think they were applauding the shot, which ended 8 feet from the hole. I sank the birdie, meaning I have now birdied arguably the two most famous par 3s in golf!

Hole #16 – 233 yards

The 16th is incredibly tough. The hole was a 240 yard shot during my round, and the carry directly towards the green was right at 225 yards. I decided to hit a punch driver intending for my miss to land in a greenside bunker. Shorter hitters have the option of playing out to the left to a fairway area, leaving a wedge to the green. I’d take my bogey and run on this hole!

Hole #17 – 386 yards

I hit driver from this tee box aiming slightly left of the group of fairway trees. In retrospect, I should have hit a hybrid and hit a longer iron into the green. My ball trickled into a bunker just left of the trees, which completely blocked me out from the green. It takes a perfect drive to have a clear shot to the green.

Hole #18 – 343 yards

The 18th hole at Cypress gains lots of criticism. I heard varying reviews of the hole before my round, and even my caddie called it a “connector hole” simply reaching back to the clubhouse. I didn’t totally agree. The tee shot is very demanding and takes a long cut in order to have a clear shot to the green. Even with what I thought was a great tee shot, I was blocked out by a tree, as seen in the lower of the two photos above. If you’ve played the course before, please comment with your thoughts on number 18!

My round at Cypress Point marked my 26th Top 100 in the World course played. Each course has been unique and incredibly enjoyable, but only at a handful was I treated better than at Cypress. The combination of the setting, history, prestige, and hospitality made it a day that I will never forget."

The course is so special, so magical, and so beautiful that it is difficult to portray the experience in writing. The club at Cypress Point delves deep to the roots of golf where players must walk their round, be accompanied by a club-carrying caddy, and rely on their caddy for distances since there are no yardage markers on the course. Gentlemen must wear a collard shirt and slacks while changing your shoes anywhere but in the locker room is stricly prohibited. Dr. Alister MacKenzie's work has set the standard by which golf course architecture is measured and the experience is second to none. If your hoping to join the club, you better track the obituaries because memberships don't open up at Cypress Point until someone dies - it's that special.

Individual Hole Analysis
Signature Hole:  16th Hole – 222 Yard Par 3 – This is one of the most famous and best holes on the known earth. Featuring the most exhilarating tee shot in golf, over 200 yards is required to carry the Pacific Ocean to a peninsula green framed by bunkers, rocks, and ice plant. A fairway left of the green is afforded as on option off the tee in the event the incoming winds are blowing too strong or if you just aren't feeling confident enough with your hybrid/fairway wood to fire straight at the green. The pinnacle of your golfing existence is reached on this tee box the first time you step on it.

16th Hole at Cypress Point Golf Club (222 Yard Par 3)
Best Par 3:  15th Hole – 135 Yards – Since the mind blowing 16th has already been featured as the signature hole, a review of Cypress Point wouldn't be complete without mention of the 16th's prettier and more playable little brother, the 15th. Playing just 135 yards, the stunningly beautiful 15th hole is surrounded by bunkers, oceans rocks, and cypress trees and offers the best chance for birdie of all the par threes. This hole represents the first of back-to-back par threes and the first hole of the best three hole stretch in all of golf.

15th Hole at Cypress Point Golf Club (135 Yard Par 3)
Best Par 4:  17th Hole – 386 Yards – This is simply one of the prettiest tee shots for a par four in all of golf. With the tee box sitting directly behind the 16th green on a peninsula jetting out into the Pacific, your tee shot gets blasted over the rocky coast to a landing area where a cluster of cypress trees await to cause havoc on your approach shot. The green slides back out toward the ocean and is surrounded by brilliant white sand bunkers and naturally jagged ocean rocks. The worst part of #17 is the feeling you get after holing out when you realize that you are only one hole away from having having to walk off perhaps the greatest course known to man.

17th Hole at Cypress Point Golf Club (386 Yard Par 4)

Best Par 5:  6th Hole – 521 Yards – I hope I don't get struck down for blasphemy by saying Cypress Point has a weak point, but clearly the par 5s at the course can't even begin to compete with the quality and drama the par 3s and 4s offer. The second of back-to-back par 5s, the sixth hole plays downhill with a fairway that slopes hard from right to left. With the portion of the fairway you want your tee shot to land out of sight from the tee box, a powerful draw will make this hole very reachable in two to one of the best green sites on the course. Classic MacKenzie bunkers surround the green site and beg the golfer to play it safe to the right side of the green and work the ball back toward the hole.

6th Hole at Cypress Point Golf Club (521 Yard Par 5)
Birdie Time:  9th Hole – 289 Yard Par 4 – One of the great short par fours in the world, the concluding hole of the outward nine is a sub-300 yarder that should get the adrenaline pumping. When the pin is in the lower tier on the right side of the green it begs long hitters to take out their driver and go for the heroic shot towards the flag. However, when perched in the upper left side of the green, sand fronts the entire putting surface on that line and cautions players from being too aggressive with their tee shot and to instead play to the fat portion of the fairway 50 yards shy of the center of the green. In match play, this is truly one of the best offerings to look forward to while looping around Cypress Point.

9th Hole at Cypress Point Golf Club (289 Yard Par 4)
Bogey Beware:  16th Hole – 222 Yard Par 3 – On the scorecard the 16th hole is identified as the #6 handicap. Trust me, not only does Cypress Point lack five holes that are more difficult, but there are few holes anywhere that are going to average more strokes over par than the par three 16th. Requiring a forced carry of 200 yards over the Pacific Ocean, many tee shots find a watery grave never to be heard from again. In fact, on a windy day it is not uncommon to see smart golfers play a 9 iron to the fairway left of the green followed up by a 9 iron into the green. Anytime laying up on a par three can be deemed an intelligent move even for scratch golfers, you know you've stepped onto one of the most difficult holes you'll ever have the pleasure of playing.

16th Hole at Cypress Point Golf Club (222 Yard Par 3)
"
5,Shinnecock Hills,top100,"Southampton, NY",William Flynn,1931,Review: Shinnecock Hills Golf Club,Andrew Harvie,rev05_shinnecock_1,"There’s not many courses as acclaimed, sought after or documented as Shinnecock Hills Golf Club. Originally built in the late 1800’s by Willie Davis, with Willy Dunn updating the course a couple years after it opened, C.B. Macdonald with Seth Raynor updating the layout in 1916, and finally, William Flynn, his partner Howard Toomey, and foreman Dick Wilson coming in 1931 to construct basically a new layout.

The design credit is given to William Flynn. The Macdonald golf course is gone, although the land where the current 3rd, 6th and 7th are remain fairly close to Macdonald’s Shinnecock Hills. Aside from the background, most people are aware of the championship pedigree of ‘Shinne’ and how notoriously difficult it is. It’s also well-known Shinnecock is one of the best in the world.

Shinnecock is one of the most difficult courses in the world, but it opens on a fairly gentle note. “Westwood Ho” is a 391 yard par 4 playing downhill into the bottom of the property.


Driver or three wood are fine off the tee for most. It’s not overly long and a nice introduction into the golf course.

However, the “gentle handshake” opener is really only on the opening tee shot. The green complexes here are so nasty and aggressive that there’s not a moment on this golf course you can walk through an approach shot. Ask Tiger Woods–he hit it over the green here in the 2018 US Open one round and made 7!


With a false front and a fall off over the back, it’s a difficult iron shot. For those who have played Pinehurst No. 2, the first green complex is similar at No. 2 as it is here, except Shinnecock’s is maybe three times as extreme.


The second hole is a long par 3 at 221 yards. “Plateau” is aptly named, with a green pushed up. A false front kicks balls to the right, while bunkering flanks the left side. Once again, the back edge falls off. The US Open tee here is 250 or so yards–insanity!


The third is another difficult hole at 470 yards, par 4. “Peconic,” named after the Peconic Bay that Shinnecock sits near (and National Golf Links of America sits on), is one of the more appealing tee shots on the golf course.


I don’t remember the exact carry on the bunkers left, but if you’re a bigger hitter, it’s best to fly those. Leaving it out to the right leaves quite a long shot into this green, and that’s something you don’t want.

One of the more benign greens at Shinne, if such a thing. It’s only partly raised up. Thankfully, it accepts low, running shots fairly easily (something most will have here).


After the long, dogleg left, a middle length par 4 swinging to the right awaits at the 4th. “Pump House” plays 409 yards with bunkering on the inside corner of the dogleg.


Flynn’s biggest strength, in my opinion, is taking basic architecture principals and flipping them on their head, and there’s potentially no better example than here. On the 4th, bunkering guards the inside corner. Basic architecture knowledge and strategy understanding would suggest keeping it closer to the inside corner, but the opposite is true. Flynn’s green contouring often dictate play, and here, the best play is to hit it to the outside corner for the best angle in.


The 5th is the first par 5 on the golf course. It’s probably a good idea to play this hole well–there’s only two 5’s!

“Montauk” is a brilliant 535 yard golf hole split in the middle by a sandy hollow covered in heather. Keeping it to the right lets the shorter hitters easier, while the left side is a bigger carry. Either side, you gotta make sure you pick your line properly!


As you can see, the front nine at Shinnecock, for the most part, is pretty flat. The land doesn’t seem too inspiring. However, upon further inspection, you see micro-undulations and little bumps that can make it incredibly difficult to hit the shots you need to. The 5th is a great example.

As you can see from the photo below, I picked the right fairway. It was a cold October morning!


The green on the 5th is insanity, with fall offs everywhere. We had a back right pin, and to our surprise, anything long or right is the wrong miss!


You can see that over the 5th green is not the best spot to me.


The 6th is a pretty difficult hole in general, but picking your line here is a difficult task with the sea of heather and sand in front of you. 456 yards, “pond” is not easy.


The namesake comes along on the approach. Unless you missed the fairway, the pond will almost never come into play. It’s some 50 yards short of the green–well out of play.


This is another great, dare I say all-world green complex. I won’t say too much, but hopefully my photo below allows you to see the genius of the shaping here!


The 7th is likely the most famous hole here. In the 2004 US Open, the USGA lost control of the golf course, and the 7th, “Redan”, was the main issue. They were watering the green in between groups because balls wouldn’t stay on the green! That’s how severe this slope is.

But anyways, as we stepped up, our caddy told us “Redan” is french for double bogey, or something. At 189 yards, you wouldn’t expect double bogeys to come as easy as they do here! But I wouldn’t know, I made 2 (yes, this is a brag–please DM Thegolfingcanuck on Instagram about it).


In terms of the “redan” template, I don’t know if this is the best rendition. Actually, I think many people turn to next door at National Golf Links of America as a good example. The biggest issue with calling this “redan” is the ground game isn’t really encouraged like all the best redans. Typically, the best redans allow the bail out short right to let the natural movement of the land guide the ball in. However, here, that’s not happening as anything short collects at the bottom.


So that leaves you flying the shot onto the green, which is impossible. There’s only about a 7 x 7 square of area on the front portion of the green you can land it on that it will stay on the green. I wish I would’ve hit mine better to see, but the tilt on this is pure madness. Take a look below.


What’s even crazier is this might be the easiest par 3 here!

This is the best advice I will ever give. If you have a birdie in you, consider making it on the 8th hole. At 394 yards, it’s one of the shorter par 4’s at Shinne.


It still requires quite a good short iron in, but it’s the flattest hole here (wonderfully named “lowlands”). A massive false front and after that it runs hard to the back is all you need to negotiate with.


I say made a birdie on 8 because you’re now into a difficult three hole stretch. Upon writing this, the 9th, “Ben Nevis”, starts the best three hole stretch I’ve seen.


A 438 yard par 4, this hole moves to the left working back up to the base of the clubhouse. You start getting into much more undulating topography as well, giving a ton of wonky lies in the fairway.

With a long or mid iron in (you will have more club in that you’d think for a 440 par 4), it is as intimidating as anything. Playing up to the top, you have to hoist a club up to have any chance.


Thankfully, the green bowls in from the right. If you need to miss one, miss it right or long, but not too right as it’ll be in the mens locker room.


But don’t miss short.


To get a sense of the scale here, below is the view of the 9th green from the 18th.


The 9th is a great hole, but my vote for the best hole at Shinnecock is the 415 yard par 4, 10th “Eastward Ho.” Playing over the topography, it’s a blind tee shot.


The land is incredibly severe over the ridge that you will almost definitely have a messed up stance. Compounding that with the shot that awaits, it becomes an incredible approach shot. This is in my upper tier of favorite holes ever.


With the green site cut on the other side of the depression, anything short runs back about 60 yards. Below is a view from where each ball would collect (thankfully, I didn’t hit it here).


Anything long isn’t much better either, but at least you’re chipping back into the upslope (oh yeah, this green runs away from you at about 3% or 4%).


Looking back, you can see the roller coaster topography that lies in the fairway. It’s a rare hole where you can’t overpower it. With driver, you likely will have an awkward flip wedge in because the ball would run down forever. With restraint off the tee, you have a full club in (a good thing).


To finish off the all-world three hole stretch, we arrive at what has been dubbed the “shortest par 5 in golf.” In reality, “Hill Head,” the 159 yard par 3, 11th, is just an incredibly difficult par 3 up the hill.


It’s like hitting onto a tabletop. There’s very little square footage here.


Anything long and left is absolutely dead chipping back downhill. This is where I hit it, but I made a “birdie” 4 on this par 5 (doesn’t count? Really?). I was happy with a 4 here after missing it in the one spot you have to avoid.

The 12th is another excellent hole. In reality, there’s not a weak hole here (obviously). The back, however, continues to deliver all-world after all-world holes. 469 yards, “Tuckahoe” plays over Tuckahoe Road.


Shinnecock isn’t exactly the most difficult driving course in the world. As you can see, there’s a fair amount of width out here. The green complexes hold up extremely well, and the 12th is again difficult. In similar fashion to the 3rd, it rises ever-so-slightly and then falls back away from the player, but there’s ample room to hit a long iron in here.


The 13th is the shortest par 4 on the course at 374 yards. The hole moves pretty hard to the right around bunkering, but again, keeping it out to the outside corner on the left allows you to be hitting shots directly into the slope to control where the ball ends up as much as possible.


For those who remember, this is the hole where Phil Mickelson decided to hit a moving ball before it rolled down the mega false front.


The 14th, “Thoms Elbow,” is another great–no, all world–hole. 463 yards, it plays through some wonderful rolling land.


The approach shot plays uphill to a green that moves to the middle. It’s one of the rare holes here–with 9–that collects shots instead of repelling them.


A closer look at the green complex. It’s almost a saddle style green, with the two outside pin positions are higher than the middle portion.


The 15th is another wonderful mid length par 4. Playing down into the valley the front nine mainly occupied, it’s a good tee shot to let one go.


No doubt, it’s a well guarded green complex. Another one that runs away from you, it’s a rare forced golf shot that needs to be played high in the air. The beauty of Shinnecock is yes, the greens run away from you, but you’re often thinking of finding the false front to bump it into. You’re really not thinking about the aerial game outside of 7, 9, 10, 11, and 15. Everything else I found myself flighting shots in.


The 16th makes the trek back towards the clubhouse. The second par 5 on the golf course, “Shinnecock” is a 540 yard three shotter.


After you get the ball in play off the tee, the layup can be quite difficult. There’s quite a few bunkers on this hole alone, so navigating them is a challenge.


The green complex is pitched hard off the left, naturally falling to the low point of the property (3 fairway) and away from the high portion (11 green/12 tee). It is a splendid par 5.


The 17th is the final par 3 on the course at 180 yards. Interestingly titled “Eden,” this plays nothing like an eden template.


Ironically, it almost plays as a redan, with the green moving down and to the left. I don’t think it is, but it’s much closer to a redan than an eden! You can get a grasp of the green complex below.


The 18th is another outstanding, difficult par 4. Doglegging to the left, like 9, it avoids the cliche uphill par 4 finisher at the base of the clubhouse.


For the big hitters, the line is just to left of the caddies over the bunker. For the shorter hitters, playing out right is the play. With some undulating topography yet again complicating things, it’s a tough finisher at 426 yards. A bunker left, two short, and one right await players. The green complex has some of the wackiest, wild, and unpredictable movement anywhere. It makes for a ton of fun. If that pin is back-left, you’d have to hit it out right. If it’s on the right side, cutting the corner is the play. A wonderful hole to end.


Hard to say anything new about Shinnecock, but it blew my expectations away still. The beauty of Flynn’s architecture here is it’s a model you could adapt. Fallaway greens are rare in modern architecture, yet they shouldn’t be. They remain entirely playable, while being difficult enough to challenge the worlds best. Shinnecock Hills is a wonderful case study on how difficult short grass and angles can be.

Is it the worlds best? Hard to say so early. The only course I’ve played that would be close to Shinne in quality is Merion Golf Club’s East course. If someone told me the best course in the world was Shinnecock Hills, I would be able to see it fairly easily. An absolute bucket list course that I’ll be dreaming about throughout social distancing! (this last sentence will age well)."
6,Shinnecock Hills,top100,"Southampton, NY",William Flynn,1931,SHINNECOCK HILLS GOLF CLUB - 19 POINTS,David Jones,rev06_shinnecock_2,"Shinnecock Hills may just be the best golf course I’ve ever played. When you are playing a top 10 course in the world expectations are generally pretty high and there can be a little something which just makes you question how close to perfection it really is. Royal County Down had too many blind shots for me, National Golf Links was maybe a little too quirky. No such worries at Shinnecock – this was simply amazing on pretty much every level.

The course is hosting the US Open in 2018 and they have been doing a huge amount of work to prepare for it.  We played in September 2016 and the fairways had been sanded, according to our caddies this was pretty much business as usual at the moment – they are trying to get the course playing faster than ever in 2018. Sand was being injected into the fairways on a regular basis to get the course running firm and fast.

Coore and Crenshaw have been working on the course and they had also widened the fairways, there really wasn’t a huge amount of intimidation from the tees, and increased the greens by around 30%. This doesn’t actually increase the ‘playable’ area of the greens as the false fronts and run offs are significant but visually it is stunning. Since then we know some of the fairways have been tightened as the USGA worry about the course being over-run but hopefully that hasn't changed things too much.

The club itself is one of the oldest and most prestigious in the world, and it knows it! The welcome we received was pleasant enough but quite formal and this is a place which is serious about its golf. There is no sense that you are a ‘member for a day’ a la North Berwick. Oh no, you are honoured to be getting the chance to tee it up here. It’s well worth making sure you spend some time in the clubhouse looking at the letters and artefacts on the walls. 

While the inside of this clubhouse is great it’s actually the outside which has the real wow factor. It is said to be the oldest clubhouse in the USA and has a real simplicity to the design, perched on a hill and you can see through from one side through to the other.

The driving range is right up there with the best and there are plenty of opportunities to blow your money in the well-stocked pro shop, again though the welcome was cordial rather than effusive. The locker room is fairly straightforward but there are some nice touches. The membership list is up on the notice board with handicaps of all the members and there are some pretty illustrious names posted.

So we made our way to the first tee with two caddies in toe, one of whom had been working at the club for over 30 years and caddied for Bill Clinton, Tiger Woods and Jack Nicklaus here over the years so safe to say we were in good hands. 

We played from the medal tees where it’s a par 70 and the course measured just over 6,300 yards. Given the run on the ball and the width of the fairways it didn’t feel that this was a course you needed to try to overpower and while the longer hitters in the group had some advantage it was playable for all. The tees were really cleverly placed for us because it felt like we were playing the same approach shots in that the pros will in many cases without having to pound it 300+ from the tee.

However, we saw some of the new tees they were putting in for the US Open and they are going to take this course back a long way. It’ll be interesting to see just how long the course will measure then but given the fast running fairways it's understandably I think on balance that they have had to tighten it up in some areas as they need to do something to defend it, beyond the devilish greens.

There has been quite a lot of work done over recent years to bring in the current ‘in’ look on golf courses. You know the type - waste areas, natural edges to green, tee boxes which seem to just be plonked down on the ground. Coore and Crenshaw have been allowed to work their magic in places and it really does look fantastic.

I’m not going to go through a hole by hole analysis of the course but I would strongly urge you to look at this post on GolfClubatlas.com if that is what you are looking for. It is a fantastic description of the course.
Shinnecock Hills Golf COurse
What I will say is that this is a course which has no weak hole. Every single one gives adds to the experience of the course. This is definitely a course that is ‘all before you’. On almost every tee box you can see what is ahead, often from a slightly elevated position. There are a lot of doglegs, with more left to right, although as a drawer of the ball I didn’t feel unduly penalised.

The course most definitely has a proper links feel to it – the ball runs fast and the greens are hard to hold and often exposed to the wind. However, you cannot run the ball up to the greens in many cases as you could at a traditional British links. This is one of the main things that I found about US ‘links-style’ courses, they played harder than their UK counterparts often for this very reason.

The two nines both return to the wonderful clubhouse but this isn’t the kind of place where you pause for too much thought at the turn, given the fun you will could having you won’t really want to. The 10th is the only blind tee shot on the course before the brilliant short 11th greets you. Famed from the exploits of the 2004 US Open this really is a tough, tough par 3. Your caddie will mention more than once that it is the shortest par 5 in the world and my scorecard would support that view!

This is a course that you just don’t want to end, and when you walk off you will know that you have just enjoyed something very special. But it is playable - this isn’t a course which will chew you up and spit you out. Sure it’s a challenge and you will find it hard to play to your handicap but there doesn’t need to be any fear on the 1st tee box - at least not from the tees we played from with little wind and greens that hadn’t been mown to the quick. I guess 2018 will show us just what a test this will give to the best in the world, but I suspect they will find this course at its peak and the reports will be nothing short of adulatory. It definitely deserves it.

BOOKING THE COURSE
Shinnecock Hills sorecard
Sigh. I’m sorry but these American courses do make it very hard. At Shinnecock though there are a few glimmers. They do accept unaccompanied guest play if you can find a member to introduce you - Pine Valley and Merion for example don’t so this makes it marginally easier to get on - however you do need to find that member and there aren’t that many of them. Therefore, if you are really keen to get on then the best route may well be to look out for charity auctions again. In the last few months I have seen 2 or 3 on Charitybuzz.com and if you set up a Google alert service you should get to find out whenever something is available. They are few and far between though and it may set you into the thousands of dollars which is a lot to pay for a round of golf, even on one of the very best courses in the world.

TOUR TIPS

I have been to this part of the world a couple of times for golf and both times stayed in the town of Riverhead - about 20 minutes from Shinnecock Hills. We stayed in the Indigo hotel the first time - just a little out of town - and the Hyatt in the middle of things the second time.  Both were absolutely fine, the Hyatt would probably get my vote next time as it was an easy walk from here to the sights and sounds of Riverhead. OK, those sights and sounds won't take you too long to explore but there were plenty of good eating options. Jeremy and the Mermaid was right next door and had good seafood at a reasonable price while the Riverhead Diner and Grill will leave you pretty full. There are plenty of well-priced pubs in town too so Riverhead is a pretty good base all round. If you fancy a 10 minute drive to the north I would recommend Cooperage Inn as a good venue for a nice meal and good service.

While this area is perfectly hospitable, Manhattan it isn't. But let's face it, you will be here for the golf. Shinnecock in a must play if you can but if you add in the likes of  National Golf Links of America, Friar's Head and Sebonack then you have an amazingly high quality golf trip which you will never forget."
7,National Golf Links of America,top100,"Southampton, NY",C.B. Macdonald,1911,NATIONAL GOLF LINKS OF AMERICA - 18 POINTS,David Jones,rev07_national_america_1,"There are bucket golf courses which everyone has heard of, courses like Augusta, St Andrews, Pebble Beach. Then there are the courses which many are familiar from great US Opens and Ryder Cups - courses like Shinnecock, Merion and Winged Foot. But then there are courses which many will not have heard of by many average golfers but are simply amongst the very best in the world. Pine Valley would be a great example of this and the National Golf Links of America is another.

NGLA, or The National, is set on the north side of Long Island, adjacent to both the classic of Shinnecock Hills and the new pretender of Sebonack. The course is deemed one of the true classics of architectural design. CB Macdonald was the man with the vision to put together a collection of some of the greatest holes from the UK on this wonderful links land overlook Peconic Bay.  

Following several years visiting the best that the UK has to offer, Macdonald returned to the US and copied many of the best holes he had seen, as well as some originals, to produce the National.

In terms of that idea I think that it would be true to say that these holes are more 'inspired by' the originals rather than real copies. You wouldn't necessarily stand on the tees and call the holes they are copied from in all cases - although the Redan fourth is a pretty good effort!

This course has a more members feel to it than some of the new courses in the area like Friar's Head and Sebonack. The locker rooms were wonderfully old school - there was an exotic array of painkillers available to get you through the round, powders to cover all conditions and an honesty box for cigars and playing cards by the door.  

There were a couple of members ahead of us so we went out to the range. Inspired maybe by the UK links ranges there was nothing special here. No island greens to aim to - just a nice big field. We had no complaints at all and the setting by the dunes and the beach was great. Here's a little video to show you what it was all about.

The driving range facilities at The National

The practice green indicated that there was going to be a good speed to the greens and running very true and after a few nerve-racking putts we went to the first tee.

A word before going on about the caddies. We had a gentleman named Threewood carrying for two of us and a younger caddie taking the other two bags. Threewood has been caddying here for 10 years and caddied for Matt Fitzpatrick in the Walker Cup. The caddies get to play the course 4 days a week - what an amazing perk.  

Billy the caddie master displays a cup in his desk by the first tee which is awarded to the winner of the annual caddy competition between National and the next door Shinecock. NGLA have won 19 of the last 20 events, something they were very proud of! Threewood is a stalwart of the team and proved to be a great caddie, his reads on the green were wonderful and did his best to keep us out of trouble.
The National Golf Links of America has a famous windmill landwark
I will not attempt to describe it hole by hole - this article on Golf Club Atlas does a great job of that. What I will say is that the course does quirkiness to quite an extreme level. You get a feel of that from the very first hole with just a rescue needed down to a dell before wedging up to a very well guarded green which has massive ridges and slopes on. The second is then modelled after the fourth at Royal St George’s which if you manage a longish carry then gives you the benefit of a run down to a very driveable green for the longer hitter. My opponent got a really close up look at the windmill as his Pro V1 struck it smack full on!

The holes are really memorable and will stay with you for a long time. The Redan hole that comes at the fourth is definitely a worthy copy of the 15th at North Berwick. I think it plays a little easier as there is a bigger layup area short right at National but the bunker short left is probably more penal.

This is the kind of course which you know if you played a second time you would score better, there are so many trap to fall into - quite literally in the case of the 'Road Hole' bunker short on the hole styled after the 17th at St Andrews.

Do make sure you take the time to enjoy some ginger snaps and cheese spread at the halfway house before taking on the bank 9. You will need plenty of energy for the challenge ahead. 10, 11 and 12 are all incredibly tough pars 4s. The wind had turned after 9 so we played the whole course pretty much into the wind and these holes were a real challenge. The last holes are probably the strongest part of the course.  

After the par 3 Eden on 13 (modelled after 11 at St Andrews) you turn for home, using the windmill as a guide all the way up to the 17th tee. These holes don't require massive length off the tee to get home but do require the right line in to avoid very well guarded greens.  

The 16th 'Punchbowl' is great fun with everything around the green funnelling the ball towards the hole and the view from the 17th tee shot is breathtaking. This hole requires a long an accurate tee shot before a precision wedge into a green surrounded by sand. It was a nice place to get my first birdie of the round.

The 18th is the only hole on the course really next to the water, a par 5 which played a good three shorter into the wind despite being under 500 yards.

The course was a delight to play. I had expected this to be something special, given it's top 10 in the world ranking and I think it pretty much delivered. The only thing I would say is that in places it felt a little too quirky. Several times I found myself in lies where I was standing a over the ball in a tiny bunker which was incredibly hard to play and while I totally accept they are hazards they did try the patience a little!  

The condition of the course was just excellent and this is probably one of the highest ‘18’ rated course I have played, I just can't quite tip it into 19 territory - maybe my next visit will change that! You can see where it sits in my all-time rankings here.
The lobster 'amuse bouche' at NGLA has to be seen to be believed!
The course at the National is only half the story. The clubhouse is something of a national treasure too with a huge amount of memorabilia from the history not only of the National but of American golf. The drawing room has tables for a game of backgammon or draughts under the intimidating figure of CB MacDonald and make sure you spend time looking at some of the great pictures, cartoons and statues dotted around the place.

The ritual of lunch at the National is not to be missed if you get the chance. While you are deciding on your choices for starter and mains you are served a whole lobster, as an 'amuse bouche' which is quite something. Following that there will be a soup or other starter (the oysters were good) before having one of the traditional main courses such as cottage pie served with a healthy side of Mac and Cheese. Washed down with a Southside cocktail and bottle of very well priced Cloudy Bay wine it was quite a treat.

If truth be told I was expecting to leave the National with this as a shoe-in 19 but when I compared it to the great courses with that score I have come to the conclusion that it is just a touch behind. The course is just a little too quirky for me. Maybe if I played it a few times it would help me appreciate it all the more, but for now I will leave it at that. The lunch, well that was a 20!"
8,National Golf Links of America,top100,"Southampton, NY",C.B. Macdonald,1911,NATIONAL GOLF LINKS OF AMERICA REVIEW,Graylyl Loomis,rev08_national_america_2,"National Golf Links of America was the last round to fall into place during the New York trip. Whenever I mentioned that I would be playing the course to friends ahead of the round, they all said the same thing, “You won’t find another course like National anywhere else! You’ll love it.” Quirky, fun, and unique were the words that kept coming up, and my excitement for the day steadily grew, especially as we played Shinnecock the day before and peeked through the trees over to National.


The course was designed by C.B. Macdonald and it remains relatively unchanged from its original layout. National Golf Links has never had the pressure to adapt the course for professional tournaments, since it has never hosted a US Open or the like. The only major changes were a new set of tees added for a recent Walker Cup. Although we didn’t play those tees, a friend who has says they elevate the course to an even higher level. Like many MacDonald courses, the layout is comprised of template holes from Scotland. However, at National, they seem to fit the landscape better than nearly anywhere else in the US. National Golf Links of America was formed in 1908 and the Macdonald course opened three years later in 1911. 


The round at National Golf Links of America started early in the day. We drove through the imposing gates, changed shoes in the classic and understated locker room, and made our way to the range. The range borders Peconic Bay down the entire left side, which made for a distractingly good view… We met our member host on the range, struck a few more shots, and made our way to the first tee.


Right off the bat I had trouble finding my rhythm at National. I thought I had hit a good drive on the first, but it was too far left, so I lost the ball. I hit my provisional on target down the right, but it went through the fairway, leading to another lost ball in the rough. Two balls lost on the first tee… The tee shot is blind on the 2nd hole and the approach shot is blind on the 3rd. I finally began to settle into the round by the 4th hole. The start reminded me of so many Scottish links that make you think, “I will play that so differently next time!” There is a lot of local knowledge at National, and despite having caddies, they can only help so much when they don’t know your game or distances off the tee. Like so many of the great Scottish links, your strategy and understanding of National would evolve and deepen over time.


I wasn’t able to take as many photos as usual at National, so instead of my typical hole-by-hole review, I want to touch on my favorite points (which are numerous…).

Hole #4 – 181 yards – “Redan” – Similar to the original at North Berwick, this hole slopes from right to left and has a series of bunkers guarding the front. The angle is slightly different than the original, but it may be the closest replica that I’ve seen. As with many other Redans, the margin for error is small on this tough one shot hole.

Hole #6 – 123 yards – “Short” – This was one of my favorite greens on the course. It is massive, and depending on the pin position, it could play in an infinite number of different ways. The front right pin made the effective size of the green much smaller. We aimed about 15 feet left of the pin where a slope carries the ball to the right. The green is very undulating, so make sure you hit to the correct area.

Hole #7 – 467 yards – “St Andrews” – How am I not going to like a hole that is modeled off of one at St Andrews?! The blind tee shot isn’t pictured below, but the approach to the green looks innocuous enough… right? Well, there is a massive bunker behind the green the requires staircases to descend. The bunker on the left – the Road Hole bunker – is almost as deep as Pine Valley’s Devil’s Asshole. It’s not easy.

Hole #8 – 385 yards – “Bottle” – A group of small, narrow bunkers split the fairway down the left. Longer hitters can try to carry them up the left, but most players take it down the right. The green is raised with an intimidating group of bunkers short that collect mishits (see photos below).

Hole #11 – 418 yards – “Plateau” – This was yet another interesting green that marks one of the best back nines you will find in America. Drives end up short of the berm for most players, leaving a semi-blind shot into the green. Two well-placed bunkers prevent thoughtless approach shots. I ended up playing mine out left because of a bunker, even though I now realize I didn’t need to. Congrats, CB Macdonald. You beat me. Does anyone else see the similarities to the sharp mound in front of the fourth on the St Andrews Old Course?


Hole #13 – 159 yards – “Eden” – The Eden green is another nod to St Andrews (Old Course, 11th hole), which is most obviously seen in the bunker in the front center of the green. Distance control is important here, as you want to avoid those front bunkers, but don’t want to go long.
Hole #14 – 341 yards – “Cape” – This hole is a dogleg right with a drive over water. The smart play is a 220-yard shot out to the left, leaving a better angle into the green. A bunker runs down the entire right side of the hole, which is where I took the picture directly below. The second photo shows the small bunkers guarding the left side of the approach shot. 

Hole #15 – 368 yards – “Narrows” – The back nine at National Golf Links of America is special, but these final four raise the bar to another level. While this tee shot is fairly straightforward, the approach to the green isn’t easy. Any shot hit long can run over the green and into a lake behind it. Short shots roll back and a bunker collects shots leaked right. Aim center of the green and don’t miss!DSC00306DSC00307

Hole #16 – 394 yards – “Punchbowl” – Some of my favorite holes in golf are Punchbowls. In fact, the Course Reviews page on the site uses the Fishers Island Punchbowl for a background image. Well-struck drives can reach the top of this hill on the 16th, but the approach shot is blind no matter where you go. There is an aiming pole behind the green and bunkers short, so take plenty of club and hold the line.DSC00308DSC00313DSC00314

Hole #17 – 342 yards – “Peconic” – The 17th is one of the best views on the golf course. Bunkers down the left and in front of the green capture and misplaced tee shots. The best play is to hit a 220 shot running into the downhill fairway. If you click the photo below to enlarge it, you will see the entrance to National Golf Links just over the right side of this green. DSC00315
Hole #18 – 483 Yards – “Home” – This hole may seem short, but it plays straight uphill. Big hitters can carry the bunkers on the left side of the fairway, leaving a straightforward approach to the putting surface. It is a great birdie opportunity with a jawdropping view of Peconic Bay.

After the round we enjoyed lobster sandwiches and Arnold Palmers in the Birds Cage, which is the casual screened-in porch overlooking the 18th hole. If the view from Shinnecock’s back porch is the ultimate golf course view, neighboring National Golf Links must have the ultimate water view. You could happily spend all afternoon there soaking in the atmosphere and wondering how you ended up lucky enough to play the course!


I was amazed at how different Shinnecock and National Golf Links are. The two courses border one another, but they couldn’t have been more different. Shinnecock’s layout is right in front of you, while National’s blind shots and hidden features mean you would notice more each round. There are a multitude of different ways to play each hole at National, and like links courses in Scotland, you stand on each green and look back thinking, “Next time I will play this hole differently…” I completely understand why people love NGLA so much and I hope I am able to return one day to peel back the next layer of genius."

Individual Hole Analysis
Signature Hole:  18th Hole – 484 Yard Par 4 – The picturesque 18th hole at Oakmont has long been touted as one of the best inland finishing holes in America. Five bunkers lie in wait of any tee shot that isn't striped down the middle of the short grass. The longish approach shot plays to a green that is protected by a series of four small bunkers on the left and a larger bunker on the right. The finishing hole typifies the entire course; a tough but fair hole that will reward good shots and make bad shots look even worse. Lastly, the clubhouse at Oakmont is as signature as any feature found at the club. The walls are covered with photos, trophys, scorecards, and other memorabilia that only an eight time host of the U.S. Open could sport.

18th Hole at Oakmont Country Club (484 Yard Par 4)
Best Par 3:  6th Hole – 194 Yards – The par threes at Oakmont aren't flashy, they are just solid. What makes this hole great is that the distance is pretty easy to handle, but the slope from right to left on the incredibly fast green makes hitting the middle or left side of the green imperative. A pin in the back right corner is just flat out mean since balls can come rolling back to the middle of the green while a chip shot from the right side of the green has zero chance of finishing close to the hole.

6th Hole at Oakmont Country Club (194 Yard Par 3)
Best Par 4:  3rd Hole – 478 Yards – Church pews - enough said. OK, I'll say more. The iconic 12 row church pew bunkers represent the most recognizable sand and fescue complex in America. Not only are the church pew bunkers cool to look at, but the are extremely penal. Avoid those bunkers and you'll still be faced with an uphill approach shot to a semi-blind green.

3rd Hole at Oakmont Country Club (478 Yard Par 4)
Best Par 5:  4th Hole – 609 Yards – While the 3rd hole assumes the reputation of the church pew bunkers, you aren't done with them until you play down the 4th hole where you will again find them resting on your left. This downhill par five is reachable in two despite the 609 yard distance it plays due to the firmness of the fairways and how much this hole ends up playing downhill. If you can avoid the church pew bunkers and the addtional 16 other bunkers on this hole then there is a good chance to put a four on your scorecard.

4th Hole at Oakmont Country Club (609 Yard Par 5)
Birdie Time:  14th Hole – 358 Yard Par 4 – The short 14th hole features a series of wide but short bunkers up the right side of this hole and five more bunkers up the left side. It seems clear that the architect is trying to force the golfer into putting away his driver, but doesn't eliminate the option all together. The green is the second largest on the course and with a wedge or short iron in your hand for your approach shot your should have a great chance of knocking in a birdie.

14th Hole at Oakmont Country Club (358 Yard Par 4)
Bogey Beware:  8th Hole – 288 Yard Par 3 – Most avid golfers are familiar with the term of 1/2 par holes, however the 8th at Oakmont is worthy of a new classification called the 3 3/4 par. At 288 yards with a 100 yard long bunker up the left side, most players will score a bogey three out of four times. The longest par three in major championship history, the 8th hole is a big, tough, brute of a hole and one of the few times you'll need to tee up your driver to reach the green.

10,Oakmont,top100,"Oakmont, PA",Henry Fownes,1903,OAKMONT COUNTRY CLUB REVIEW,Graylyl Loomis,rev010_oakmont_2,"The journey of playing top golf courses around the world takes you down unexpected roads. I was sitting at my desk at LINKS Magazine when an email came into my inbox. It was from the USGA and it offered the chance to play Oakmont in the 2016 US Open Media Day. The only problem was that it was a Tuesday, and the media day was less than a week away. I immediately booked a flight with my boss at LINKS and we started planning a last minute trip to Pittsburgh!

The funny thing is, I’ve been planning a Pennsylvania golf trip for this coming August. We have a round booked at Merion and Oakmont is a possible round on that trip. The thought crossed my mind to hold off and wait to play the course in August, but like they say, “a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush.”

Because it was the USGA Media Day, we attended a short presentation from a number of Oakmont and USGA brass before lunch in the clubhouse and an afternoon round. One of the most interesting speeches came from Mike Davis, the President of the USGA. He said that Oakmont was one of the only courses in the states that could host a US Open with two weeks notice. The course stays in championship condition throughout the season. Among many other things, he said that the normal course rating at Oakmont is 77 from the tips, but the course rating is close to 82 come US Open week… let that sink in while you gain even more appreciation for Johnny Miller’s 63 back in the day (and remember it’s a par 70)!

Oakmont was founded by Henry C. Fownes. He was a steel man who sold his business to Andrew Carnegie. Carnegie got him into golf, and Fownes proceeded to find land just outside of Pittsburgh to build a course of his own. Like many of the great course founders/designers, it was his “one hit wonder,” and he settled into a penal mindset with the design. Henry and his son William, who followed his father as club president, added bunkers, sped up the greens, and did everything in their power to make golf at Oakmont hard. William Fowne’s famous quote, “a poor shot should be a shot irrevocably lost” sums up the Fownes’ mindset very well.

I was told before the round that Oakmont was incredibly difficult. I’ve played very difficult courses before, but Oakmont was different. There was literally no margin for error. Combine that with having never seen the course before and it was all made tougher. My caddie would say, “Hit this down the left side of the fairway.” I would proceed to hit a well-struck drive down the middle, just right of target, and we would find it in the thick right rough. The greens speeds were some of the fastest I’ve ever seen, which made the short game exponentially harder. The player with a great caddie and tons of course knowledge will do well this June in the US Open.

My only “negative” comment about the club addresses something outside of their control. The Pennsylvania Turnpike runs right through the middle of the course. Crossing the bridges twice during the round isn’t tough, and the interstate is sunk into the ground, so it’s not even visible from much of the course. My complaint has to do with the noise. It is constant on much of the course. It isn’t a huge negative, but it means that Oakmont lacks that “sanctuary” feel that is present at many of the other truly great courses.

Hole #1 – 441 yards – Big drives will catch a downhill slope, leaving a wedge into the sloping green. Approach shots run hard left once on the putting surface.

Hole #2 – 325 yards – Long irons or hybrids land in the widest part of the fairway and leave short irons into the green. The dry creek bed along the left edge of the fairway is marked as hazard, but you can pitch out in dry conditions.

Hole #3 – 390 yards – Yes, those are the Church Pews along the left side! Don’t be short on this green and just as important, don’t be long. Balls run over this green easily into a difficult collection area (as I found).

Hole #4 – 512 yards – Although it isn’t mentioned much, the Church pews are in play again on the 4th hole. The blind layup and subsequent approach to the narrow green make it extraordinarily difficult.

Hole #5 – 349 yards – Favor the right side of the fairway on this blind tee shot. The short approach to the small and undulating green will be a fun one to watch during the US Open.

Hole #6 – 168 yards – One of the course changes since 2007 was flattening an area of this green to create more pin placement options… and it’s still extreme!

Hole #7 – 370 yards – The fairway is fairly wide for this blind approach, but the bunkers and deep rough surrounding the green are no joke.

Hole #8 – 225 yards – This is the legendary 300 yard par 3. It played about 235 during our round, but the large open front of the green allows for running approaches.

Hole #9 – 462 yards – The 9th plays back up to the clubhouse and a massive green. The rear of the putting surface doubles as the practice putting green. The distance on this hole may seem short for a par 5, but it plays uphill the whole way.

Hole #10 – 440 yards – While the 9th played longer uphill, the 10th plays shorter back down the hill. It narrows substantially closer to the green, so bigger hitters can just play a 3-wood down the right side of the fairway.

Hole #11 – 328 yards – Back up the hill again! Drivers aren’t necessary here for longer hitters, especially since a driver could reach the creek.

Hole #12 – 562 yards – This tee shot begs for a smashed cut that runs downhill and right on the sloping fairway. This is a birdie opportunity.

Hole #13 – 153 yards – Although the green is sloping, this is one of the easiest holes on the course. It should reflect that in US Open scoring.

Hole #14 – 340 yards – Difficult bunkers line both sides of this fairway, which narrows closer to the green.

Hole #15 – 434 yards – The tough finish begins here. The approach shot is blind, and penal Church Pew bunkers line the left side of this fairway (Did you know there is more than one set of Church Pews at Oakmont?).
Hole #16 – 211 yards – This hole is a beast. The bail out is left, but that leaves a very long put across the green to a back pin (click to enlarge the photo and look at the back right pin).

Hole #17 – 296 yards – This hole can make or break someone’s tournament (or round in the amateur’s case). Smart money plays a short shot up the right side and wedge into the green, but bold players can go for the green. See the small red flag in the distance? Also, don’t end up in any of the bunkers around the green.

Hole #18 – 430 yards – It all ends with a picturesque hole back to the clubhouse. The fairway bunkers on the right are very much in play. Most difficult of all is the sloping green – DON’T be above the hole.
Oakmont Country Club exudes history, tradition, and beauty. The clubhouse and locker room are on-par with some of my favorites. The course is extremely difficult, and frankly, it would be discouraging to play when struggling with your game. That being said, I’m sure it’s a fun feeling to shoot mid 80s at Oakmont before you go bust a 70 at any typical golf course around the country!2"
11,Sand Hills,top100,"Mullen, NE",Bill Coore/Ben Crenshaw,1995,Sand Hills Golf Club: The Club TFE Profile,Andy Johnson,rev011_sand_hill_1,"In 1995, in the remote Sandhills of Nebraska, Bill Coore and Ben Crenshaw changed the trajectory of golf course architecture. Sand Hills Golf Club proved that a faraway course on spectacular land could work. It was a “field of dreams” moment for the golf industry, which had been focused for decades on building in population centers. Developer Dick Youngscap deserves immense credit for pushing the crazy idea of taking golf to the small town of Mullen, four-plus hours away from any major airport.

Take note…

Sand Hills was built on a shoestring budget. Coore & Crenshaw did very little earthmoving. The only green that required a considerable shaping effort was the par-4 fourth green, which benches into the big sand dune and falls off hard on the right side.
In its original form, the 12th hole did not have a green-side bunker. That was added one year after opening to enhance the strategy of the hole.
On many properties, creating 18 holes is a challenge. At Sand Hills, the challenge was figuring out which 18 holes to use. Near a staircase in the clubhouse is a constellation map of holes from Coore & Crenshaw’s many routing ideas and efforts. It shows the over 130 potential golf holes in and around the valley where the current course resides.
Favorite hole

No. 2, par 4, 284-458 yards I’m a sucker for great holes early in the round, but there are a few other reasons why I love the second at Sand Hills:
Restraint – On a site where there are natural spots for bunkers everywhere you turn, the second hole has only one in play, and it’s there more to deceive golfers than to gobble up golf balls.
Green site – The most memorable moment from my first visit to Sand Hills was climbing the hill on the second hole and walking toward the green. The horizon line formed by the back of the green is all you see, and you feel like you’re approaching the edge of the world. Once you see the endless sand dunes in the distance, you get a sense for the magnitude of the locale. This view gives a context for the rest of the round.
Green contours – This is one of the most undulating greens on the course, and it’s really fun to hit shots into it. The ball will tend to funnel to pins on the left and be deflected from pins on the right. Both sides are exciting in different ways.
Overall thoughts

This is one of the greatest courses in the world. There’s so much to marvel at as you walk it. Two aspects of Sand Hills that stick with me most are how well the course embodies its place and how thoroughly worked out the strategic concepts of the holes are. I can’t think of any other club I’ve been to that has such a distinct feel and culture. These traits are shaped by the town of Mullen more than the membership itself, and much of the credit for that dynamic belongs to the club’s visionary, Dick Youngscap, who empowered the local staff to be culture setters. Sand Hills is unapologetically unique and its own. It’s not trying to be anywhere or anything else. Almost everyone treks long distances to get there, and the emphasis is on one thing: the golf. The accommodations are spartan, the food is outstanding but simple, the people are incredibly nice, and the golf is world-class. Part of what this course and its culture prove is that luxurious accommodations and amenities aren’t necessary. What is necessary is an outstanding course and a strong community looking after it. It’s easy to see that Mike Keiser learned something from the culture of Sand Hills and applied it to Bandon Dunes. If you’re curious what Sand Hills is like, imagine a more intimate and remote Bandon Dunes with slightly less stellar accommodations. Now on to the golf course itself. Every hole at Sand Hills has preferred lines. These can change day to day based on different hole locations and winds. Coore & Crenshaw were working with a tremendous place for strategic golf, as the natural elements are off the charts. The wind, dry conditions, and sandy soil make everything come alive. Coore & Crenshaw found strategy in a variety of ways: natural terrain, green contours, devastating hazards. Generally—and wisely—they opted for natural topography rather than artificial bunkering in many spots. Sand Hills is a great example of how the best architects are often the ones confident enough to leave a piece of ground alone and know that the topography will do the work for them. I don’t believe it would be possible for a serious golfer to play Sand Hills a few times and come away without at least a basic understanding of how golf strategy works. Along with the 18th hole, which we’ve already written about, the 14th is maybe the course’s clearest example of strategic design. This reachable par 5 offers an advantage to playing up the left because the green, the smallest on the property, is angled to accept shots from that side. Furthermore, the left half of the fairway offers the chance to catch a massive downslope into a big hollow, which will add 60-plus yards to a tee shot. The problem is, playing left is a risk because a massive blowout bunker sits there. Finding this bunker will eliminate almost all hope for a birdie and make for a challenging par. Hitting a long tee shot up the right is fine, but it leaves a difficult second shot, with a bunker short, a bunker long, and about 10 yards of green to work with. Even a layup is tricky. There’s plenty of room to the right, short of the green-fronting bunker, but it’s a nervy pitch from there. To lay up left, you have to contend with another massive blowout. Almost every hole at Sand Hills puts players in this position—take the risk right now or pass it off to the next shot.

If I were to critique two things about Sand Hills, I’d focus on the 13th hole and the lack of a walking culture. The par-3 13th is breathtaking; I’m just not sure it sets a consistently achievable task. Perhaps it’s yet another victim of increased green speeds, but the margin for holding any part of this green is very slim. As for the walking piece, I’ve been disappointed with how much cart golf at Sand Hills, which is such a wonderful—if hilly—place to walk. To be fair, the Sand Hills membership is on the older side, and most members go there to play golf all day. But I still wish more decided to walk and truly take in one of the cathedrals of the game. Sand Hills changed golf architecture. It’s a course that should be visited and studied by anyone interested in golf architecture as a profession. And keep in mind that for average joes, Sand Hills is attainable. A letter explaining why you want to experience the course may open up an opportunity for an afternoon round, an overnight stay, and a morning round. Not every letter is answered, but some requests are granted. It’s certainly worth a try. -AJ
Egg score: 3 Eggs

Sand Hills is everything a three-Egg course should be. The land is unique, beautiful, and perfect for golf. The design matches it, as we discussed earlier. It’s varied and strategic, and accommodates a wide variety of shots and skill levels. Superintendent Kyle Hegland does a marvelous job presenting the course, with the native vegetation deserving special praise. When you hit one out of play and into the taller grass, it’s usually easy to find your ball and feasible to get it back in the fairway. This is what well-maintained native does: it allows for the possibility of a heroic shot from an unpredictable lie. And that’s what you find at Sand Hills."
12,Sand Hills,top100,"Mullen, NE",Bill Coore/Ben Crenshaw,1995,Sand Hills Golf Club - Top 100 Golf Courses of the World,top100golfcourses,rev012_sand_hill_2,"The Sandhills region of Nebraska is a huge meadow, which extends to some 20,000 square miles but amidst the cowboys and the grazing cattle, lies a magnificent sandy tract of golfing ground, which is otherwise known as Sand Hills Golf Club.

Sand Hills Golf Club is a club to respect and those in the know admire their non-commerciality, which is a welcome break from tradition in these days of the perennial money-go-round. One hundred golf holes might easily have been laid out on this amazingly natural piece of land, but Bill Coore and Ben Crenshaw settled on just eighteen. But make no mistake, they discovered the best possible routing and each and every hole at Sand Hills is very special indeed.

The ""Golden Age of Architecture"" inspired Ben Crenshaw and Bill Coore to set up together sharing the philosophy that traditional, strategic golf is the most rewarding. And, when Sand Hills opened for play in 1995, they must have been quietly delighted with their achievement.

Sand Hills has only a few lucky members, and surely each and every one of them must belong to another golf club. Why? Because Sand Hills is closed for eight months each year… overplayed it is certainly not.

With wide, generous fairways that wind their way beside huge dunes, Sand Hills is a big course on a big scale and it’s tempting to open your shoulders. But beware of the sand. You will need to be either an extremely good golfer or a very lucky one to avoid the crater-like bunkers at Sand Hills Golf Club.

Darius Oliver had no doubt about the importance of Sand Hills his book Planet Golf USA, calling it “arguably the most important American golf course since Augusta National.” The author continued: “Its opening not only placed this remote and seemingly desolate region firmly on the golfing radar, but it almost single-handedly led to a rebirth in classic golf architecture in this country.

Although winds can whip through these Nebraska plains with great force, they don’t come from a prevailing direction, so the designers were careful to ensure their holes were playable under all conditions.

Fairways are sensibly spacious, while the target areas are mostly open to encourage chase-in approach shots. The diversity of the putting slopes is quite astonishing, as is the variety of the actual green locales, whether they be pitched in hollows, set atop plateau or built beside exposed sand dunes.”"

However, in 2012 I had the opportunity to attend a day of the Masters and regard it as one of the most enjoyable days of my life. Augusta National is a club like no other in the world and upholds the honors and traditions of the game with strict importance. Respect for members, club personnel, and the course is expected at all times; no exceptions. The course closes after Memorial Day and reopens in the fall upon the completion of any projects deemed necessary for the upcoming Masters. From what I hear, the experience at Augusta is unmatched. Video archives of the previous Masters are available to watch in the evenings when not on the course. Want to see Nick Faldo win the Master back-to-back in 1990 and 1991? Just ask, politely, and your wish will be granted. Want to relive Tiger's memorable twelve stroke victory? Not a problem. When playing at Augusta, a caddie will carry your clubs bag and help read greens as you stroll along the most immaculate and healthy turf in the world. There are only two sets of tees at the course (neither or which have slopes or ratings), the Members tee and the Masters tee, further confirming Augusta's mission and commitment to hosting the greatest golf tournament in the world. Simply put, Augusta National represents Bobby Jones' dream and is the holy grail of golf.

Individual Hole Analysis
Signature Hole:  12th Hole – 155 Yard Par 3 – One of the most famous holes in the world and the heart of Amen Corner! This gorgeous hole can be as treacherous as it is beautiful. With Rae's Creek fronting the green and a pair of bunkers to the rear, absolute precision is necessary to hit this green in regulation. Located at the corner of the property and bordered by majestic trees, the winds can get swirling in this portion of the course and cause havoc with club selection. With its extensive history and unmatched beauty, Augusta National's 12th hole ranks among the finest holes in golf.

Best Par 3:  16th Hole – 170 Yards – Redbud has yielded more aces during the Masters than any other hole at Augusta and is yet another beautiful offering. The green features a large pond to the left and three bunkers around the putting surface. A spine is the middle of the green feeds balls left which creates mega drama when the pin is placed on the left side of the green in the traditional Sunday placement. During practice rounds at the Masters this hole has become an entertainment spot where players intentionally skip their tee shot off the water and onto the green. One of the most memorable moments on this hole came in 2005 when Tiger Woods had missed the green to the left before chipping his approach up onto the putting surface only to see it hang on the edge of the cup for a moment before collapsing into the hole and propelling Tiger to victory.

Best Par 4:  10th Hole – 495 Yards – The large iconic bunker in the middle of the fairway on this long par four is the last remaining distinctive stamp that is left of Dr. MacKenzie's work. The attractive edging on the bunker is inspired by camouflage from Alister's days in the army and used to be much closer to the green. When Perry Maxwell reworked the hole in 1937 the green was pushed 50 yards back so that the sprawling bunker is now more of a visual intimidation than it is a hazard to contend with. The hole plays well downhill and setups up for some dramatic results, as has been the case in recent years as the 2nd playoff hole during the Masters. It was on this hole that Bubba Watson hooked his approach shot from the trees onto the green before two-putting to victory. Most recently, this is where Adam Scott converted a birdie putt to edge out Angel Cabrera to become the first Australian to earn the coveted green jacket. This hole was also the beginning of the end for a young Rory McIlroy that hooked his tee shot into the trees before taking a triple bogey and watching his Masters dream walk away. Love it or hate it, the 10th hole at Augusta is the pivotal beginning of golf's most famous back nine.

Best Par 5:  13th Hole – 510 Yards – Other than perhaps the 18th hole at Pebble Beach, no other par five in the world is more highly regarded than Augusta's famous 13th. Brilliant in design, the hole banks from right to left with the fairway sloping left towards Rae's Creek. With the ball above your feet and creating a natural draw, the green calls for a ball to fade into the putting surface over Rae's Creek while managing to avoid the hillside of bunkers to the rear. Tee balls that draw around the corner significantly reduce the yardage into the green yet ball that stay to the right, shy of the trees, setup for a great angle to the putting surface. Phil Mickelson's bold and miraculous approach shot from the pine straw on the upper right side of the hole in 2010 has become an iconic image in Masters fan's minds. One thing is for sure, this hole always plays an exciting roll in the final outcome Sunday afternoon at the Masters.

Birdie Time:  15th Hole – 530 Yard Par 5 – One of the things that makes Sunday afternoon at the Masters so exciting is the risk/reward nature of the reachable par fives. The 15th plays up to the crest of a hill where players are then greeted with a downhill view of the green completely fronted by a pond. A lone bunker sits to the right of the putting surface and the drop area off to the left. The green is twice as deep on the right side as the left and a pond rests well beyond the putting surface in the event an approach shot comes in too hot. If you can't reach the green in two, there is a flat area to layup to on the left side of the fairway which will setup a short chip and an excellent birdie opportunity. The most recent drama at this hole occurred Friday afternoon in the 2013 Masters when Tiger Wood's 3rd shot ricocheted off the flag and into the water. In a temporary mental lapse, Tiger took an illegal drop which originally was deemed legal. However, following his remarks in an interview after the round, the committee deemed the drop inappropriate and Tiger was assessed a two stroke penalty the next morning. In terms of birdie time, the hole played the most strokes under par in 2013 while yielding 16 eagles and 118 birdies compared to 143 pars.

Bogey Beware:  11th Hole – 505 Yard Par 4 – The beginning of Amen Corner, this par four measures just five yards shorter than the par five 13th. A big drive is required to the top of a hill before the fairway begins fading right and then finally banking slightly left. Rae's Creek rests on the left side of the green and wraps around the back instilling fear into players as they hit their approach from the fairway that tilts left. Birdies are very rare at the 11th hole, the most famous of which was Larry Mize's improbable 140 foot chip that found the bottom of the cup and won the 1987 playoff over Greg Norman. Bogies (or worse) outnumbered birdies nearly 4:1 in the 2013 Masters; bogey beware indeed!"
14,Augusta National,top100,"Augusta, GA",Alister MacKenzie/Bobby Jones,1933,Augusta National Golf Club - A Cinderella Story,John Sabino,rev014_augusta_2,"""I shall never forget my first visit to the property... The long lane of magnolias through which we approached was beautiful. The old manor house with its cupola and walls of masonry two feet thick was charming. The rare trees and shrubs of the old nursery were enchanting. But when I walked out on the grass terrace under the big trees behind the house and looked down over the property the experience was unforgettable.""

Augusta Entry Drive

The quote leading off the post is not mine, but is from Bobby Jones. His recollection is from seeing the property before the course was built and it is still the perfect description of it to this day. My attempt to capture my day at Augusta is below. Lou Holtz once said, ""I'm often asked to explain the mystique of Notre Dame. I reply, 'If you were there, no explanation in necessary. If you weren't, no explanation is satisfactory'."" For those who haven't had the opportunity to play it, it is quite difficult for words to do it justice. For those who are among the lucky ones who have, no explanation is necessary.

Augusta National Golf Club (ranked #5 in the world) is the hardest course in the top 100 to get on. I probably have to qualify my prior sentence so I don't get bombarded with email from Down Under reminding me that Ellerston Golf Club is probably the hardest in the world to get on, but that's another story and wasn't on my to do list. It took me fifteen years to get invited to Augusta National, but I finally managed to do it in style. All the pictures on this post were happily taken with my camera, and as you can see, the conditions were perfect when I was there. It was 74 degrees and sunny with a slight wind.

What better circumstances are there to play Augusta National than when the azaleas are blooming, when the course is in tournament condition and with a Masters winner or two? Well, none.

I saved the best experience for last, and walking off the eighteenth green of Augusta National as the last hole to complete my quest is the only way to finish. I am one very lucky bastard.

After I was invited to play at Augusta National it was overwhelming, and it took several days for me to come back down to earth. Because I am just a little anal and clearly I like lists, I immediately began to keep three: 1) People who were previously my friends who told me they now hated me from jealousy; 2) People who offered to caddie for me if needed; and 3) People who wanted ""Augusta National"" and not ""Masters"" logo items that you can only buy in the pro shop in the clubhouse. Sleeping the night before playing at Augusta was restless at best, the sense of anticipation was crushing. Sitting in my hotel room prior to the round, I was a clinical example of adult ADHD and displayed all the symptoms in classic form: inattention, hyperactivity and impulsiveness. I was babbling, moving things around the room senselessly and not listening to a word my wife said.

What was it like?

Short answer: Wow!

Long answer: It was one of the greatest experiences of my life, if a bit overwhelming. Driving under the canopy of trees lining Magnolia Lane is something I never dreamed would happen to me, so the range of emotions that I felt when it happened were wide, as I was trying to comprehend my dream being realized. The most prevalent feelings were joy, fear, excitement, disbelief, exhilaration and anticipation.

As anyone who has ever been to the Masters knows, everything about the place is perfect. Walking through the door of the plantation-style antebellum clubhouse is as memorable an experience as riding down Magnolia Lane. Having previously been to the Masters twice, I had already experienced the jaw-dropping awe of the property and its rolling hills. Not that it ever gets old, because it doesn't. Being anywhere on the verdant Augusta grounds is special, no matter how many times you have been there. This time, being able to walk into the clubhouse, an act previously verboten, was truly amazing. I do believe I had the biggest smile of my life on my face when I entered.

As with everything else in this adult version of Disneyland, the interior of the stately clubhouse is flawless. It is the antithesis of glitz and ostentation; it is simple, but elegant; the ultimate embodiment of understated Southern charm. There are scores of little touches they get right, including a mounted display board in the entry foyer. The board has slots that hold the engraved names of members who are currently on the property. They slide little brass name plates in and out as members enter and leave the property. I did my best not to gawk at the board, but did recognize a couple of names, including a former Secretary of State who was present. The clubhouse, with a two-story veranda around the entire building was built in 1854; is a veritable museum; touring it is special, as it holds the permanent Masters trophy, special golf clubs donated to the club from past champions and a big oil painting of President Eisenhower. Ascending the winding stairway leads you to the second floor, which houses the dining room where they hold the champions dinner each year and the champions locker room. Starting with Bobby Jones, and thinking about all the great golfers who have been in the clubhouse and walked over these hallowed grounds over the last 80 years gives me goosebumps.

My warm-up was on the driving range used during the Masters instead of on the members driving range. I have obviously played a lot of good golf courses and have experienced teeing off at some famous locales that are pressure packed, such as the Old Course at St. Andrews and the first tee at Merion with lunch in progress. Hitting my first tee shot at Augusta was the most nerve-racking of all and shortened both my breath and my back swing. My palms were sweaty and my stomach full of butterflies. The first drive is over a big swale, and although the fairway is wide, the target area is not, since it narrows between the huge bunker on the right and the big Georgia pines on the left. In retrospect, it was one of the narrowest fairway landing areas on the course. Making contact with the ball on the first tee was special. Having the ball actually go my normal distance down the fairway was a bonus!

I played well on the first six holes, then the gravity of the situation hit me and I fell apart for two holes. It is really hard to comprehend that I was lucky enough to be able to actually play Augusta National. Many thanks to the caddies who helped me stay calm and in the present and enjoy the moment. Just as all roads lead to Rome, all golfers dream of the back nine at Augusta on a Sunday afternoon, and here I am in just such a spot.

The practice putting green is near the tenth tee at Augusta National. After we teed off on ten, a multiple-time winner and Ryder Cup captain walks up to the tee and says, ""Do you guys mind if I join you on the back?"" Hard to conceive of, right? My playing partner says, ""No problem with me, John, is it ok if he joins us?"" What am I going to say, ""No, I'm sort of in a groove, why don't we continue as a two-some!"" My fairy tale story continues...

Nelson Bridge #13 Augusta
Nelson Bridge over Rae's Creek from the 13th tee to the 13th fairway, as seen from Hogan Bridge

From tee to green there is no rough; so, truth be told, putting your ball in play is actually not that hard. The course plays 6,365 yards from the member tees. The fairways are generous, they look and feel like carpets, and every lie is perfect. The greens are also perfection, without question the best in the world.  The most difficult shots tee to green are those you have to hit off of the pine needles if you hit off the fairway. The real tests of Augusta National are chipping, holding your ball on the greens and putting. The greens are fast, as you would expect. They are significantly harder on the back nine, in my humble opinion. In particular, I found the thirteenth, fourteenth, sixteenth, seventeenth and eighteenth to be like putting on the top of a glass table.

I am an average golfer (15 handicap) and if there is one hope that I had going into the round it was to play Amen Corner well. A sense of calm and peace overtook me as I walked onto the eleventh tee. To be able to hit the same shots the professionals hit is a dream every golfer has. To be able to pull it off and not cease up was a treat. One of the highlights of my life was hitting the middle of the eleventh green in regulation (the hole plays 400 yards from the member tees) with a shot that got a ""great shot"" shout out from two former tournament winners. Luckily, my birdie putt was captured by my alert caddie who knew the gravity of the moment and took the camera out of my golf bag without being asked. I rolled it to within six inches. I was not disappointed with a tap in par to start Amen Corner. Walking over the Hogan Bridge is something that cannot be described; it is a solemn, spiritual experience.

Birdie Putt on #11 Augusta
Putting for birdie on #11 on a brilliant day with the azaleas in bloom

Standing on the twelfth tee I mentally blocked out the water, the ultra-shallow green, the bunkers in the front and in back, and everything else. I adjusted perfectly for the one club wind, visualized the shot, saw only the flag and took a very deep breath. I ended up hitting one of the best shots of my life, eight feet from the hole. This is the reason you stand on the range year after year and hit tens of thousands of practice balls; so that when you need to, you can pull off the shot of your life, and it was satisfying. On #12 the member tee and the pro tee are in the same place, so I had the exact same shot they hit during the Masters, a 155-yarder over Rae's Creek. My putt broke a good cup and a half and when it landed in the bottom of the hole for birdie, it was hard to absorb. I have had my ups and downs with my golf game over the years, but it was very satisfying to birdie what Jack Nicklaus calls, ""the hardest hole in tournament golf."" I was one under through two holes on Amen Corner, and hit a drive straight down the middle of the thirteenth fairway.  I didn't so much walk over Nelson Bridge as I did float over it.

#13 tee Augusta
The view from the back tee on the thirteenth

My luck ran out when my ball rolled back off the thirteenth green, but I was still overjoyed, having just lived every golfer's dream. When the legendary golf writer Herbert Warren Wind coined the phrase ""Amen Corner,"" he described it as your second shot on the 11th, the entire 12th hole and your tee shot on 13. In the original true sense of Amen Corner, I played it to near perfection. My favorite hole was the thirteenth; it is just breathtaking and on a scale that most golf holes can never achieve. The back tee on the thirteenth is one of the most peaceful places in the world. It sits in a little alcove set among the splendor and beauty of Augusta, and standing there one has not a care in the world.

#13 green Augusta
The approach to the par five thirteenth green over Rae's Creek

I am blessed, and for some reason the golf gods were good enough to let me play to my handicap when I played Augusta National. As is typical, I had my ups and downs. I hit my tee shot on sixteen into the water,  pulled my ball through the Eisenhower Tree on seventeen, hit my fair share of chip shots fat and three putted more than normal, as the greens were tournament ready. After my final putt dropped on the eighteenth green I shook hands with two green jacket winners. To say I was in a state of elation is a gross understatement. At that moment, I was the luckiest man on the face of the earth.

As an added bonus, after the round I also got to play the par three course and to have a drink in the champions locker room. It is quite small and intimate, with only three tables that seat four at each. The veranda outside the room overlooks the circular entry drive and Magnolia Lane. The room was full when I entered and I will leave it to your imagination as to who was in the room and what happened next. If I told you, you wouldn't believe me anyway. Hollywood couldn't have scripted it any better.

I have a big imagination. You have to, to envision playing Augusta and completing this quest. My experience at Augusta National exceeded anything I could have ever imagined. Any one of my experiences that day are remarkable in and of their own right. Are my descriptions hyperbole? Not in the least, when you experienced what I did as the culmination of a long journey. Collectively, they are truly hard to take in and represent a dream come true. The title song from The Wizard of Oz sums up my day:

Somewhere over the rainbow, way up high
There's a land that I've heard of once in a lullaby.
Somewhere over the rainbow, skies are blue
And the dreams that you dare to dream,
Really do come true.

Would you go if invited?

Links Magazine did a readers poll a couple of years back and asked the following question, ""You're on a business trip in Atlanta and have an important meeting that cannot be rescheduled. The night before the meeting, you receive a last minute invitation to play Augusta National Golf Club the following morning. What do you do?""

57% responded that they would skip and meeting and play
43% said they would attend the meeting

The 43% are clearly out of their mind. Are you kidding me?

What PGA players think about Augusta

Sports Illustrated polled the players in 2012 about the Masters. Their answers are below and my opinion in parenthesis.

1. The 11th hole was ranked as the hardest. (I think the seventh and tenth holes are harder)

2. The 12th hole was ranked as the best hole and as the favorite shot on the course (hard to disagree)

3. The 13th hole was ranked as their favorite hole (I agree)

4. 62% of them had never tried the pimento cheese sandwich!

5. 50% of those polled said the major they would most like to win would be the Masters

Some of my favorite quotes about Augusta

""The course is perfection, and it asks perfection"" - Nick Faldo

""You get the feeling that Bobby Jones is standing out there with you"" - Lee Janzen

""I always said that if they have a golf course like this in heaven, I want to be the head pro"" - Gary Player

Augusta truisms

There are three truisms that anyone who has been to the Masters knows:

1. The neighborhood the course is in is more befitting to a suburban strip mall in New Jersey and is lined with Waffle Houses and fast food chains.

2. The steepness of the terrain doesn't come through on TV. Especially how much the first hole plays down and up. Also, the uphill shots required on nine and eighteen are much more dramatic when seen in person, given the big elevation changes. The most dramatic hole of all is the tenth, which plays almost straight down hill.

3. The entire property is perfect. Quite literally perfect. There are no weeds. Nothing is out of place. Those who have been to the Masters know how perfect it is, including the wooden pine bathroom houses that are spotless. The interior of the clubhouse is also perfect. I don't know if they paint the place every day, but the interiors of the buildings look like they were freshly painted. The flooring is polished, the carpets are spotless and look freshly laid, and the lucky people working there are charming and gracious, and make you feel at home. No detail is too small to overlook at Augusta National. Inside the clubhouse they don't use an electric vacuum cleaner since the noise would disturb the perfect ambiance of the place. Instead, they use an old school push style that makes no noise.

Unlike any other

Pine Valley is the #1 ranked course in the world and Cypress Point is #2, and an absolute dream land. Everyone talks about Pebble Beach, and you get chills playing the Old Course at St. Andrews when they announce your name on the first tee. But the course EVERYBODY asks about when I tell them what I've been doing is Augusta. Have you played Augusta? How did you get on Augusta?

I have played in some unreal and memorable places. My day at Loch Lomond was exceptional. My experience and the ambiance of the hunting lodge at Morfontaine is still something I think about all the time. It is also pretty hard to beat an overnight stay at The National Golf Links of America. Yet, this is the one to tell the grand kids about (some day). Everyone I meet in my life from now on will hear about my birdie on the twelfth hole.

Augusta trivia

Some interesting trivia facts about Augusta taken mostly from David Owen's The Making of the Masters:

1. The tress that line Magnolia Lane were planted before the Civil War

2. President Eisenhower never attended the Masters because of possible security problems

3. Before there were tour caddies, golfers recruited bellhops from the local Bon-Air Hotel to serve as caddies

4. Cliff Roberts handled Eisenhower's personal finances and investments

5. The golf shop makes change with new bills because Clifford Roberts didn't like dirty bills

6. There are no tee times at Augusta National. Captains of industry are very civilized and no doubt don't all show up at once. The limited number of cabins for overnight play self-regulates the number of people that play, as most members don't live locally.

7. The two nines originally played in reverse. The 1934 Masters was the only one played with the front and back opposite of the way they play today.

8. Augusta has no slope and course rating from the U.S.G.A. thus you can't really post your score after playing. I'm not sure why they never had the course rated, perhaps to do with privacy and limiting access?


What will you do now that you are done playing the top 100 courses?

People have asked me this question a lot. I contemplated giving up golf altogether, since what I just did can't be topped. Like Bobby Jones, I thought, wouldn't it be great to go out at the top. Jones retired at his peak in 1930 after winning the impregnable quadrilateral, as he termed the Grand Slam. My friends reminded me that I'm no Bobby Jones, so a few other ideas I'm kicking around:

1. Go back to Cruden Bay and play it over and over and over

2. Go and sit in the Sunningdale clubhouse for a week drinking Guinness and smoking cigars

3. Try to join the Links Club in New York

4. Eat at the top 100 restaurants in the world

5. Move to Queenstown, New Zealand, herd sheep and drive a taxi while playing golf at Jack's Point a lot

How did you get on the course?

Unfortunately, like in Las Vegas, what happens at Augusta National stays at Augusta National. This will remain my secret. That is, unless my book deal comes through with its big advance, in which case I will give all the details :). What I can say is that asking to play is futile. Like joining the club, you can't ask them, they have to ask you. Asking to play is an automatic no. Think about it, members would be inundated with requests every day if you could ask them to play since this is the course every golfer obsesses about. In this regard, Augusta National is truly unlike all other golf courses in the world. If you meet a member of Shinnecock Hills or Riviera or many of the other top courses, chances are you can ask them and as long as you are not a total JO, you can usually get invited, as they are proud to show off their course, especially to those that appreciate the history of the game and golf course architecture.  A prior post of mine does outline the ways you can get onto the course:  A Dozen Ways to Play Augusta. Good luck if you are trying, and sorry, I can't help.

What are your favorite courses and holes?

Alas, a complex question best answered by this post: The Best Holes and Courses. My day at Augusta was by far the best overall experience of my journey playing the top 100 courses given what happened to me on that day. In terms of the course only, I would rank only a half-dozen or so courses above it including Cypress Point, Sand Hills, the National Golf Links of America, Merion, and Sunningdale. My top five holes in the world are the thirteenth at Augusta, the fifteenth at Cypress Point, Maidstone's fourteenth, Kawana's fifteenth and the seventh at Sunningdale.

Was it hard to play the top 100 golf courses in the world?

Yes. To put the feat in perspective, by completing my quest I become only the 23rd person to do so, the same number of men who have been to the moon: The list of those who have completed playing. I tried to calculate the percentage of people in the world that have done this and dividing 23 into 7 billion gave a result with a lot of zeros after the decimal point. The odds of winning the lottery are higher than the odds of playing all 100 of the top golf courses in the world.

The hardest courses to get on aside from Augusta are Morfontaine in France, Hirono and Nauro in Japan, Wade Hampton in North Carolina, San Francisco Golf Club and The Golf Club in Ohio.

Thank you 

A heartfelt thanks to everyone who has been kind to me along the way, particularly those that hosted me and had to tolerate looking at my terrible swing. Thank you to all my loyal and supportive readers. Special thanks to my mates Tom, Chris and Sheldon who accompanied me to many of the world's great golf courses and are fabulous company. We have shared many laughs together. Thank you for being such good friends, I couldn't have done it without you. The biggest thanks of all goes to the most tolerant and greatest wife in the world! Thank you.

One of the lessons learned from this experience is to be patient. I pressed hard to get on Augusta for years and for the last two had sort of given up, and figured completing the top 99 courses in the world would be a pretty good feat. Little did I know that all those previous no's and rejections in my attempt to play the course were for a reason. Fate had decided that my quest should end with the ultimate climax. Just like in your game, sometimes when you give up, you play your best. Other lessons learned: be nice to everyone you meet, think big, have perseverance and persistence, and believe. There is no way to pay everyone back that helped me, so I will continue to pay it forward and share my luck and good fortune with others.

This will be my last post now that the quest is complete.

Post Script - Did I mention I birdied twelve?"
15,Merion (East),top100,"Ardmore, PA",Hugh Wilson,1912,MERION GOLF CLUB (EAST) - 18 POINTS,David Jones,rev015_merion_1,"It’s funny how you can have an idea of what a golf course is going to look and feel like, just to be completely contradicted as soon as you get there. Merion would be a perfect example of that for me. In my mind I had this as a heavily tree-lined, slightly claustrophobic, incredibly tight course. It is tight, because of the lush rough, but it is actually one of the most open properties that I have ever played. On much of the way around you can pretty much see the whole course and it really does have an ‘open’ feel to it.

I was luck to play here just a few months after the renovation by Gil Hanse and this is clearly a really quality golf course that is at the top of its game. The conditioning was just superb, with the greens running very true and just beautiful to play on. While the conditioning was spot on, it’s worth saying that the rough was fairly brutal. It was very thick, meaning sometimes it was hard to find the ball, and always difficult to move it forward. Having played a lot of golf in a short period of time prior to arriving at Merion, it would be fair to say I wasn’t firing on all cylinders and as such spent far too long looking balls in the thick stuff!

If you look at the scorecard for Merion it looks like this should be a course you can score on - from the members’ tees we played it was about a 6,200 yard par 70. While that may look inviting, believe me it plays so much harder. Anyone who keeps to handicap around here is worth a good 2 or 3 shots when they go somewhere else. 

If you are a fan of quirks then Merion is right up your alley. One such example if that there are only 2 par 5s on the property, and they both come in the first 4 holes! 

The course has a distinctive rhythm to it - with the thirds often referred to as Drama, Comedy and Tragedy.  The first six holes certainly ask some tough questions. After the dogleg first you find a par 5 with beguiling OOB on the right and then the long par 3 third where you need to fly the ball all the way to the green to avoid punishing rough and bunkers. However, by the 7th things definitely calm down and you then have a bunch of short par 4s and a couple of great par 3s - one long and one short. While this may tempt you into thinking you can attack the course a little don’t be fooled, be off line and the punishment will be just as bad as on the first 6 holes. This stretch of holes has some of the most of interesting and most fun holes you will find anywhere, with some wonderful, memorable nuances. 
The restored approach to the 16th at Merion is visually stunning and quite a test
The restored approach to the 16th at Merion is visually stunning and quite a test

The finish at Merion is tremendous - one of the very best you will find anywhere. The 16th is a par 4 where, for your second shot, you are forced to play over a quarry which Hanse has now restored with wonderful bunkering. There is a path around the right if you don’t fancy the carry. I went for the heroic route and failed. 

The 17th is a long par 3 - over 240 yards from the championship tees - which plays downhill to a huge (by Merion standards) green with a lot of movement in it. 

And then to the 18th, where Hogan famously hit his approach shot in the US Open all those years ago. From the championship tees it is a tough task. It’s a blind tee shot and then a long iron in to this green with a huge false front meaning that par here is a really great score. It really is a stunning finish. 

Looking back, I wish I had planned my trip to Philadelphia slightly differently. We played Pine Valley twice before making the trip to Merion and maybe it would have been better to have it the other way. Pine Valley is so ridiculously magnificent in every way, Merion was always going to be hard-pushed to match it.

Don’t get me wrong - this is a very fine course. Pretty much every hole asked a good question - how best to survive or how best to take advantage of what you have in front of you. The course looks wonderful. By all accounts Hanse has elevated it to a new level and the test is strong. 

However, something stopped me quite falling in love with this course. Much is made of how the routing works so well on a pretty small piece of land. Of course, that’s true, but Kingston Heath knocks it out of the park with the same challenge. The rough here is a little too brutal, and the punishment for missing the greens too great, to make this course a really fun one to play. 

Having said that all of that, of course if you get the chance to tee it up here you should jump at it. It’s championship golf of the highest order and a course that any fan of the history of the game would want to see.
BOOKING THE COURSE

OK, you can’t exactly call up Merion to book a tee time but it isn’t quite in Pine Valley’s league. Having said that, at some courses, like Shinnecock, you can play without a member being on the property with you. Not at Merion - here you need to be hosted at all times. The good news is that there are a lot of members and many of them play here quite regularly and are keen to show off the course. If you haven’t got a friendly member on speed dial then set up a Google alert for Merion charity auctions. Members quite often auction off the chance to play with them and there are also a few charity days. It’s not cheap, but it is possible.
The scorecard from Merion

TOUR TIPS

Merion is one of the great old courses in the USA and it would be a shame not to factor in plenty of time to explore the club. One of the most famous features here is the terrace that sits next to the first tee where members will be having their lunch while you tee off. In fact, when we played, the members tees were set slightly forward from the throng and it didn’t feel like we had too many eyes on us as we teed off.

This didn’t feel as ‘old school’ a club as Shinnecock or NGLA. We were there on a Sunday afternoon and there were a lot of women around as well as a bunch of kids and it had a little more of a ‘country club’ atmosphere to it. Having said that they were sticklers for etiquette and there is no doubt that golf is the focus here.

The pro shop is really well stocked and it’s hard to leave without a few items adorned with the wicker basket logo. The locker rooms were as traditional as they come and the showers had water pressure that even Muirfield would be happy with. We were heading off for a transatlantic flight straight after the round so had a good shower, but the lack of curtains did give off a certain ‘1950s British Boys’ School’ ambience which I think could have been done without!"
16,Merion (East),top100,"Ardmore, PA",Hugh Wilson,1912,Review: Merion Golf Club (East),Andrew Harvie,rev016_merion_2,"Merion is, well, everyone knows of Merion, but most people don’t actually know that there’s two golf courses at this storied club. The West, down the road, is also a Wilson/Flynn, and the East, which is the one most of us have heard of. Needless to say, my expectations were high going in. I had a great day planned with two of my best golf pals and our host, who was a rockstar (which only enhanced the experience by a mile!). Back to the golf. Let’s jump into this wonderful little golf course.

Act I: The Drama

Merion’s East course is divided into three acts. Like a Shakespearean play, each act tells a different story and provides a different task. However, Shakespeares play are five acts (18 holes isn’t divisible by 5!). To start the golf course, you’re greeted with a 350 yard par 4.


Many have talked about how difficult the first tee shot is. No, not because it’s tight or long (obviously not), but because of how close it is to the patio of the clubhouse restaurant. You are steps from people having lunch. Thankfully, we teed off at 3:00 on a rainy October afternoon, so not too many people watching!


Just a couple spectators for the opening tee shot. On a warm summer afternoon this would be packed!
The opening hole gracefully moves to the right around a pair of fairway bunkers. A greenside bunker on the right side forces the player to go to the outside corner for a better angle.


As you can tell, I didn’t pick the right side of the fairway
After crossing Ardmore Ave, the first of two par 5’s on the golf course await. 589 yards on the card, it’s a long par 5 with O.B. all down the right and fairway bunkering on the left.


As I blasted one O.B., my host told me “you haven’t played Merion until you’ve hit one onto Ardmore Ave!” Happy to say I hit the ceremonial ball O.B. then, although it didn’t help my score too much.

This is kind of the first introduction to the scale of Merion. In the suburbs of Philadelphia, you wouldn’t expect this much movement, but it’s quite uphill on the second shot! Avoid the bunker for the second shot and you should be good to go.


The green angles to the left, in typical fashion. The closer to the right (and O.B.) you go, the better your look into the green becomes. With a wedge, however, not a huge deal.


Somewhere early in the stages, Merion, like National Golf Links of America, had template holes all over. There was a Sahara, Redan, Eden—some of them or soft renditions. Somewhere in the early stages as well, C.B. Macdonald, the pioneer of templates in North America, was involved. The third, originally, was thought of as a reverse redan template. Today, it doesn’t play too much like a redan.

At 219 yards to a green cut on the other side of the gully, it’s a beast.


I haven’t wrote too much about the greens yet, but they’re very difficult. There’s a ton of movement, and often times, there’s massive ridges running through the middle of the green that can make it very difficult to get to back pins. On the 3rd, with a back left pin, we saw that in action. A closer look at the green complex on the 3rd with the beautiful wicker basket.


The 4th is a monster par 5 at 628 yards. The aiming bunker cut into the hill is a perfect line to rip one over.


Words don’t really describe how difficult this second shot is. Frankly, it could be the most difficult layup shot on a par 5 I’ve ever played. A huge bunker cut at the top of the hill is perfectly placed. The length makes this an issue, even though it’s 200 yards or so to the green from there. If you play over it, you don’t see the ball land and you’re playing from a downhill lie. If you lay back, you’re dealing with the bunker and a potential blind third shot with a long club in.


The green is quite big with lots of pin locations, but there’s a copious amount of bunkers surrounding the green, and Cobb’s Creek fronts the green as well.


This is such a strong par 5. Par here is an excellent score. And that’s the last of the par 5’s! Merion ends with two par 5’s coming in the first 4 holes. From here on out, it’s 3’s & 4’s. You can get a sense of the scale below.


And the elevation profile. It really shows you how downhill the hole actually plays


The 5th, once described by Tom Doak as the world’s only “perfect par 4” would be the best hole on almost every other golf course in the world. It very well could be the best hole here, but there’s a couple contenders to me. At 504 yards, it’s a beast with a creek slithering along on the left. The hole banks hard to the left, with the fairway’s right side higher than the left side by about 15 (!) feet. hitting it up onto the right side is ideal.


From there, the hole continues to pitch hard to the right. A bunker up on the right hand side catches balls that need to be laid up (hazard, bunker, or rough, whichever). A line just over the the left edge of the bunker is ideal to kick the ball down.


I wish I would’ve got more photos of this hole because it is so good. But funny story: I actually drove through the night from Toronto to get to Philadelphia, picked up my friend who took the red eye from Edmonton, Alberta, and went and played Cobb’s Creek with a couple of local GCA enthusiasts the morning prior to Merion. It was a big day, I might’ve missed a couple photo opportunities.

Hole 6 is another difficult par 4 that we played around 440 yards. The US Open tee is out of commission, I believe, which would’ve been around 490. Two bunkers left and one aiming bunker right help you navigate the blind landing area.


The approach is a bit more low-profile than the first couple holes, but a false front stops balls. It’s a good green with quite a bit of movement towards the front.


Act II: The Comedy

What’s really special about this golf course is the routing. You don’t notice it through the writing, but 2 goes to the outside, then you turn inside for 3, 4, then 5 wraps back in between 4 and 2, and 6 comes out near hole 2 before turning to the outside of hole 4 for 7-9. Merion’s routing loops in on itself, but it wasn’t always like this. Here’s the previous version:


Quite a bit has actually changed from this original routing thanks to William Flynn. Hole 1 is different. The routing has also been switched up a bit. On that photo, holes 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 are actually 6, 7, 4, 5, & 3 in that order. Additionally, 10, 11 and 12 are very different on todays golf course, but we’ll get there. Below is the current routing.


The 7th starts the “Comedy” stretch of the golf course. Where the “Drama” gets the golf course onto a mixed bag start, the “Comedy” portion is made up of four short par 4’s, a long 3, one short 3, and a mid-length 4. It’s a great stretch of holes to make birdies. One of the beauties of Merion is that good players know they need to make birdies here to make it through the final Act, while members may sneak in a couple pars in this stretch and be happy with it.

Anyways, the 7th is 360 yards with O.B. to the right. One bunker on the left is probably best avoided, and this is the bunker you stood next to on the tips for hole 4.


The green it perched up, pitching hard to the front. With a wedge or short iron in hand, it can be difficult to control spin.


The 8th is a very good golf hole. 356 yards, a bunker right and left are staggered. Depending on the yardage you choose to play off the tee, one of the two will be in play.


A bunker short left and the restored ditch from Gil Hanse on the right front the green here. It slopes hard towards the ditch on the right. With a pin on the right side, it can be tough to keep the ball below the hole.


The 9th is a monster par 3 at 231 yards with Cobb’s Creek fronting the green and a huge bunker that the green wraps around on the left.


Here’s a different, closer to angle to hopefully show the undulation of this green. It’s a lot.


The 10th is a fun, drivable par 4 at 303 yards. Swinging hard to the left around a bunker on the inside corner, a layup (if you elect to layup) will have to flirt with the four bunkers on the outside corner for the best angle.


A big bunker short of the green from the tee and left from the fairway is the main defence. The green is more subtle in nature than the past couple, so a great birdie opportunity.


The 11th is most likely the most famous hole at Merion. Bobby Jones in 1930 completed the grand slam on the 11th green. Since then, it’s obviously become a milestone hole. At 367 yards, it’s a short hole playing downhill. A shared bunker complex on the left with hole 12 might be in play for some, but I imagine most will get it down the hill.


To a small green tucked behind Cobb’s Creek, it’s a very fun wedge to hit. As long as your ball doesn’t stay on the downslope, you’ll be good!


Part of the restoration, Gil Hanse & his team raised this green to prevent flooding from Cobb’s Creek, which has happened (so I’m told) fairly regularly if they get a rainy spring.

The 12th is a 403 yard par 4 doglegging up the hill that the 11th fell down. Three bunkers on the outside corner are wonderful aiming lines, but don’t get in them!


The fairway cants hard to the right, which actually helps the ball travel closer to the hole and sets up a fade to a green angled to the right. There is so much movement towards the front in this green that being under the green is paramount. Had it not been misting all day, I could see someone putting off the front of this green pretty easily if they’re above the hole.


The 13th plays on the other side of Armore Ave, and you won’t cross it again. It’s a very short par 3 at 115 yards, but ask Phil Mickelson—it’s not easy!


From experience, don’t hit it in that front bunker. Again, there is a ton of movement in this green, and almost collects like an upside down saddle (at least on the right side).

Act III: The Tragedy

After the drama and the comedy set the stage, the tragedy is all ready to ruin your round. It’s 5 holes of absolute madness.

The 14th is a 425 yard par 4 swinging hard to the left around a bunker that’s 275 to carry. A slew of bunkers on the outside corner of the hole await as well, and if you get really anxious, O.B. is way left. Getting the ball in play here is paramount.


You’ll notice on the approach shot instead of the wicker baskets it’s now the white flags. The club collects these wicker baskets and switches them out towards the end of the night because fraternity members at nearby Villanova University challenge other rushing members to steal a wicker basket to get access to the fraternity. Crazy!


This greens best characteristic, in my opinion, is the back left portion of the green, which is very cool and adds a fun pin position.

The 15th, a 411 yard par 4 swinging to the right, is harder than the yardage lists. O.B. all on the outside corner of the dogleg is certainly in play. It’s a different take; typically O.B. is seen on the inside corner (even last hole!) and you work on not turning it towards the hazard too much. On the 15th, you make sure you turn it away enough!


Playing up the hill, the approach shot up is a difficult one to judge. Again, a ton of movement towards the front of the hole, and certainly in the front portion. Staying below the hole is the best call to action.


The 16th starts. areal ‘meat & potatoes’ tough as nails finishing stretch. At around 440 yards, it’s not overly long. Getting the ball in play is so key here. If you miss, it’s not good.


From there, you chuck up a Hail Mary mid to long iron to a big green over the quarry. For the record, I hit it into the quarry and it wasn’t good. I did make a good up & down for 7, but that’s beside the point.


To make matters harder, the green has a massive ridge running through the middle that makes anything in the back half incredibly hard to get close to.

For those who miss the fairway, or have too much stick in for their second, the restored bail out on the right (which is actually 15 tee) is a perfect spot to play the 3rd from. Here’s a view of the quarry. Again—don’t hit it in here.


The 17th is a 246 yard (!!!) par 3. Working its way back down into the bottom of the quarry, it plays. a bit down the slope.


A fairly big ridge in the front portion of this green stops a lot of balls from running up. It’s said that this dip in the fairway/ridge in the green is inspired by the Valley of Sin at St Andrews. If it wasn’t hard enough, the green is surrounded by bunkering.


The 18th is a monster par 4 to finish. 510 yards, it requires a carry of 240 or so yards over the carry just to get the ball in play.


Playing over some wonderful rolling terrain, the 18th is a wonderful finish to an epic day at Merion.


So that’s Merion! It’s a very strong golf course. Speaking on the golf course, Jack Nicklaus famously stated:

Acre for acre, this may be the best test of golf in the world
No doubt, Merion at 126 acres is a very impressive golf course. It still blows my mind that on such small acreage, you never feel cramped, and the scale is quite big. After Gil Hanse’s restoration, it’s looking and playing great. One of the most special days in golf for me, and a course I’ll remember forever!"
17,Fishers Island,top100,"Fishers Island, NY",Seth Raynor,1926,Raynor’s Final Symphony: Fishers Island Club,Andy Johnson,rev017_fishers_1,"Architects are often judged by their masterpieces. For Alister Mackenzie, it’s Cypress Point. For Charles Blair Macdonald, it’s National Golf Links of America. For Donald Ross, it’s Seminole. For A.W. Tillinghast, it’s Winged Foot. For Seth Raynor, it’s the Fishers Island Club.

Special thanks to Jon Cavalier for use of his photos in this profile. Seth Raynor was cast as C.B. Macdonald’s right hand man for the early years of his career. But as Macdonald’s interest in designing courses waned, job inquiries trickled down to Raynor, who perfected his architecture craft and gained a deeper understanding of the game at courses like Shoreacres, Camargo, Blue Mound, Yeamans Hall and the Course at Yale. Fishers Island was Raynor’s final and greatest symphony. During his short but illustrious career, Raynor often turned less-than-desirable land sites into spectacular courses. His portfolio of template holes – the redan, cape, short, biarritz and double plateau – ensured a course delivered a fun, thought-provoking and strategic test. At Fishers he got a waterfront property with tremendous natural land movement. He turned it into one of the finest courses in the world. Unfortunately Raynor didn’t live to see the end product. He caught pneumonia as Fishers Island was nearing completion, forcing his associate Charles Banks to finish the course.
The experience

Entrances are often talked about at golf courses. The drive into a club builds anticipation and excitement for the day. Fishers offers a truly unique “entrance” – a ferry ride across the Long Island Sound to the island. Coming from the Nauck Harbor, we rode the Popeye shuttle and arrived at the dock situated off of the 17th hole. After a quick stroll down the wood planks, our carts awaited us and we drove to the clubhouse. Unlike many exclusive clubs, Fishers Island is the furthest thing from “stuffy,” offering a laid-back vacation vibe that makes you feel at home.

We met the superintendents, Don Beck and David McIntyre, by the putting green, each of whom quickly apologized for how “green the course was,” music to our group’s ears. It was subtle, but the comment exemplified what Fishers is – a golf course architecture fan’s nirvana. For first-time readers, let me make it clear that there is nothing I love more than a firm and fast golf course. I believe that the effort to present a green golf course is one of the major issues with golf, creating sustainability issues and promoting poorer playing conditions for the average player. Raynor was known for his bold green concepts; the redan, the double plateau and the punchbowl have massive ridges that make them easily distinguishable. But the subtle ridges, rolls, spines and humps in his putting surfaces at Fishers are what places them among the best in the world. These design subtleties are woven in from the tee through the green on every hole at Fishers Island. I often judge a golf course by whether it inspires an immediate replay. At Fishers, my play was not good, but on the 17th hole I was sad to see the round nearing its end. The course and club deserve all of the acclaim and possibly more. It’s one of the finest golf courses in the world.
A quick history lesson

Started by the Ferguson family in 1925, the Fishers Island Club was set out to be modeled after Mountain Lake, the vibrant country club community in Lake Wales, FL. Naturally the Fergusons went after the man behind Mountain Lake, Seth Raynor, to design their golf course on the farmlands of Fishers Island. Upon walking the property, Raynor found two superior sites for 18 hole golf courses, one where Fishers Island sits today and another that was planned to be developed until the Great Depression cut plans short and the additional course’s development was abandoned. Over the years, Fishers has done an exemplary job of keeping the original golf course intact and staying true to Raynor’s intentions, planting few to no trees, maintaining firm and fast conditions and recently undergoing work to recapture the original green sizes.
The course

The 6,636-yard par-70 course is filled with jaw-dropping vistas of the Long Island Sound and Raynor’s famed template holes. Two of Raynor’s standout skills – routing and building green complexes – are on full display at the venerable site. His routing maximizes the holes on the water, providing drama at every turn while using the natural land movement as his fairway hazard, only employing two fairway bunkers on the course. The overlooked aspect of Fishers’ routing is how nearly every hole plays in a different direction, which allows the course’s best defense, the wind, to play a starring role. Golfers are kept in a constant state of confusion as they try to find the exact direction and strength of the wind on a given hole.

While a few holes are similar in direction, none are identical

HOLE #1 “Raynor’s Start” – 396 yards – par 4 As is customary with most Raynor designs, the first is a friendly start. The wind is typically at your back and the tee shot plays downhill. The water on the right comes into play 300 yards from the tee, requiring longer players to choose whether or not to play aggressively. The fairway cants from left to right, and the green is perched with a light back to front slope playing slightly uphill. One of the subtle, strategic aspects of the 1st is how the safe play off the tee is down the left side, but on that half of the fairway the left-to-right slope is severe. Consequently, a shot to the left of the fairway yields a more challenging approach shot than the flatter right half, which carries the risk of the water.
HOLE #2 “Redan” – 184 yards – par 3 The original green for the 2nd hole was lost to a hurricane, forcing the club to rebuild the green. The hole plays slightly downhill and the wind is a critical factor. As with all redan holes, the green slants from front-to-back and right-to-left around a deep front bunker. Unlike most golf holes, the ideal miss on the redan is long which leaves an uphill putt or chip to the pin. This rebuilt version of the template is gentler than most, and therefore plays more tamely, especially with regard to the kick slope.
HOLE #3 “Plateau” – 335 yards – par 4 One of the most memorable holes at Fishers Island is the short par-4 third, which plays uphill and seemingly to the edge of the world. The hole doglegs slightly to the right and tests the appetite for risk. The safe play is a long-iron up the left side, but a well-struck driver can get long-hitters close or even home. The dominant features at the 3rd are treacherous greenside bunkers, which flank the right and left sides of the narrow back to front sloping green.
HOLE #4 “Punch Bowl” – 412 yards – par 4 The fourth is considered by many to be the greatest golf hole in the United States. It’s a variety of the Alps template and perhaps the greatest version in golf. The strategy of the hole is dependent on the day’s pin position, which is noted by a peg board.

If the flag is on the right side of the green, the left side of the fairway is preferred and vice versa. A smart play is to pull long iron and play it up the fairway, leaving a short to mid-iron approach to the blind green. If you choose to play boldly, a driver that cuts the corner will leave a wedge shot and maybe even a partial view of the green. For those who lay up, the second shot requires trust in your line off of the Fishers Island flag that marks the center of the green. The yardage to the pin cannot be measured by lasers and your swing will feel unstable as the wind typically is whipping down and off the Sound. Coming over the hill and seeing the punchbowl green set back against the ocean is a sight to behold and one that is truly unforgettable. While it has bold exterior contours, Raynor’s subtle spine which runs through the middle is the true genius of this putting surface. The simple contour plays a factor in nearly every pin for shots just a little off-target.
HOLE #5 “Biarritz” – 229 yards – par 3 Continuing on the jaw dropping stretch of holes is the biarritz fifth, which plays parallel to the Long Island Sound, giving the long par-3 the added challenge of strong winds. With the water on the right, the natural bailout for golfers is left, where Raynor places two deep trench bunkers. The front of the biarritz is kept as fairway and when the course is firm and fast, the approach is conducive to low-iron shots that bounce the ball onto the green. The green complex is a big square, which has back to front slope and another subtle ledge that comes into the play on the back half. This divides the left two-thirds of the green from the back-right corner, which is slightly elevated for a devilish pin position.
HOLE #6 “Olinda” – 555 yards – par 5 The first par-5 plays from the shore back into the mainland and shows off the incredible natural land movement on the island. The new tee box is back to the right and semi-blind, favoring a fade to the fairway, which slightly angles right. After reaching the top of the hill, a beautiful view of the green awaits, giving a preview of the terrific seventh hole as well. The 6th often gets overlooked among Fishers’ amazing waterfront holes, but Raynor’s restraint from using fairway bunkers is beautiful, opting to allow the natural rolling land to obstruct players shots and layups. Finding a relatively flat lie is difficult and makes it a challenge to go for the green in two or even lay up in the correct position. The green is another square complex, which slopes from back to front. In the last year the back portion has been recaptured, which repels balls off the green. An interesting aspect of Raynor’s design approach is how on the lengthy par-3 second and the fifth he rewarded players who boldly miss long, while on the shortish par-5 sixth, a bold player who misses is penalized with a very difficult recovery.
HOLE #7 “Latimer” 363 yards – par 4 Perhaps the most overlooked great hole at Fishers Island is the strategy-packed short par-4 seventh. Playing from an elevated tee, the first decision posed to the player is whether to play aggressively with a driver or lay up short of the salt marsh. The second choice is which side of the fairway to favor. The safe side is left but it leaves a poor angle, while the ideal approach comes from the right side but brings the salt marsh into play. Due to the elevated nature of the green, an approach from the fairway is necessary to hold the firm, wind-blown putting surface, which slopes from back to front and features a dramatic false front.
HOLE #8 “Road Hole” 465 yards – par 4

The eighth was converted to a par-4 in the early 2000s and is a challenging rendition of the road hole. With the sound on the right and a pond on the left, a good tee shot is a must to this fairway that slopes heavily from right-to-left. Typically playing into the wind, a solid tee ball still yields a lengthy approach to the tough template green, which is guarded by a deep front pot bunker. There is plenty of room to bail right but it leaves a tricky chip across the green, which slopes from right to left and back to front.
HOLE #9 “Double Plateau” – 365 yards – par 4 Fishers’ front nine comes to a dramatic close with a short par-4, which features one of golf’s greatest green complexes, the double plateau. The tee shot is blind, up over a hill and one of two fairway bunkers on the property. After navigating the tee ball, Raynor treats golfers to another great reveal, as the double plateau green seemingly floats out over the sound. Its bold undulations divide the putting surface into three distinct segments that, when playing firm and fast, make the proper approach angle critical. If the pin is front-left, the proper angle is from the left; front-right, the right side is preferable and with the back pin the center to left side of the fairway is best.
HOLE #10 “Knoll” – 401 yards – par 4 Make the turn and players are treated to a rare sight, an unchanged and original knoll hole, one of Raynor’s templates that was often ruined by greens committees who thought they knew better. Completely bunkerless, the 10th is one of the toughest holes on the course. Finding the fairway is a must to set up a reasonable approach to the elevated green, which repels balls that are slightly short, long, right or left. Depending on the pin position, the favored approach angle will change, giving players a little more green to work with on their approaches. As the wind picks up the 10th only gets tougher.
HOLE #11 “Eden” – 164 yards – par 3 Photos don’t do the 11th justice. The short par-3 is perhaps the best representation of the famed Eden hole at St. Andrews. The green slopes severely from back to front and right to left making any putt from above the pin dicey. The worst place to miss on this challenging par three is in the devastatingly deep “hill” bunker.
HOLE #12 “Winthrop” – 389 yards – par 4 After the truly remarkable waterfront stretch of the Nos. 3-11, Raynor navigates players inland toward a stretch of overlooked holes that possess incredible strategic challenges and phenomenal green complexes. The first of those is the 12th, which embodies a great deal of strategy stemming from its elevated, reverse-redan green complex. Off the tee, players have to decide how aggressively they will play, taking anything from a driver to a long iron. The fairway has ample undulation that moves from left to right and has a large hump which can obstruct approach shots with an uphill or downhill lie. The green slopes hard from left to right and front to back and has a subtle knob in the middle that affects putts to almost every pin. The hole typically plays downwind, which makes the approach shot extremely difficult to hit close because of the green that slopes severely away and is perched some 30 feet above.
HOLE #13 “Waterloo” – 400 yards – par 4 The 13th plays back towards the 12th tee and is a slight dogleg right. Much like the twelfth, the strategy is influenced significantly by the wind direction. If it’s into the prevailing wind, the play off the tee is a driver down the right side of the fairway which opens up the ideal approach angle to the large squared off green, avoiding the second and final fairway bunker, which is blind from the tee. The second shot plays over a pair of ponds and into the green complex, the star of the show. It has a false front and bold kicker on the left corner, which feeds shots toward the center. Raynor bisected the green with a small spine that penalizes players who miss their mark to the right or left and the front-left section of the green has a small bowl that makes for a fun pin.
HOLE #14 “Cape” – 425 yards – par 4 On the flattest piece of the property, Raynor went to the fail safe template he used at every course he designed – the strategy-packed cape hole. Long hitters will be tempted to carry the water down the left at 290 yards, but the prudent play is an iron to the right. The ideal line is down the left side of the fairway, which drastically shortens the approach shot into the green but carries the added risk of the water. I fanned a 3-iron to the right side of the fairway and was left with 200 yards into the green, a number that could have been 30 yards less had I taken my tee shot down the left side. The green is another special one with bunkers on the right and left, and a severe false front. It requires an excellent approach shot to make a birdie. I found the back-left portion of the 14th green to be the most interesting as it features a small ridge that allows for a slightly bolder approach to the green with the comfort of a backstop.
HOLE #15 “Long” – 541 yards – par 5 The 15th starts Fishers’ closing stretch with a reachable par-5. The tee shot is blind and over a marsh obscuring a generously wide fairway. The right side of the fairway opens up the green, especially the back-left corner for those attempting to get home in two. The green slopes heavily from back to front and is guarded by bunkers on either side. The left bunker is particularly deep and a brutal spot to find yourself if the pin is on the left side. Like most greens at Fishers, the 15th has many small intricacies. The right third of the green plays into a small bowl with the left two-thirds elevated and on its own tier.
HOLE #16 “Short” – 146 yards – par 3 This photogenic short hole is extra difficult at Fishers because of the always-present wind. Despite playing less than 150 yards, I was forced to hit a 6-iron because of the prevailing wind, which typically is in player’s face. The green is surrounded by trouble with bunkers catching small misses and marsh penalizing the wide misses. As is typically the case, Raynor saved his wildest green for the short, making par a formidable test on the seemingly easy par-3. The 16th green’s exterior slopes funnel shots on the edges into the bunkers while the center slopes to the right, with a thumbprint on the back half making any putt not directly below the flag extremely fast. The unique aspect of Fishers’ short is the right side, which is obstructed from the tee but allows for a pin that seemingly floats above the marsh. Getting to that pin is a tall task and the prudent play is just slightly left of it, allowing the slope to funnel the ball to the corner.
HOLE #17 “Coast Guard” – 415 yards – par 4 The 17th features one of the widest fairways on the course, which allows players to set up a proper angle to attack the day’s flag. The prevailing wind at Fishers typically has the 17th playing into a strong left-to-right crosswind, which makes the second shot to the big green difficult. The green is sloped from back to front and has a false front which repels any shots slightly short or with too much spin. There is a small spine that runs down the left third of the green, creating an added obstacle for any pin on the left half of the green.
HOLE #18 “Home” – 452 yards – par 5 The closer at Fishers Island is a long and challenging par-4 that plays into the prevailing wind. The tee shot favors a fade and will leave a mid- to long-iron into a boldly-contoured green. The second shot plays uphill and the large, wide green is guarded by bunkers in front and to the right. Raynor gave players an ample opening to play a low running shot into the green, which is divided into three distinct sections: the front-right portion, which slopes significantly from back to left; the back ledge; and the front-left bowl. Hitting the green in two is an accomplishment, but a player who finds themselves on the wrong ledge will be left with a challenging two-putt to close out the round."
18,Fishers Island,top100,"Fishers Island, NY",Seth Raynor,1926,Fishers Island Club: A *Very* Remote and Memorable Round of Golf,Sean Ogle,rev018_fishers_2,"My journey to Fishers Island happened in a very unexpected way.

I was in New York City (you know, back when I used to travel), and saw that I had a friend from out of town who was also in the area on a golf trip.


I shot him a note saying something like “Hey, you’re in NY too?! Any chance you have time to get a round in?”

“Our schedule is pretty tight, but you know, we may actually have a spot for a forth on Wednesday. Let me check.”

“Can you make it to the New London ferry terminal by 7am Wednesday morning? If so, you can join us for 36 at Fishers Island.”

I’d be lying if I said that was the response I was expecting.

And the answer is? Of course. Absolutely, I will do everything I need to do to be at that ferry dock.

Getting to Fishers Island Club

The reality was a little more complicated than I’d hoped.

I got about 3 hours of sleep before hopping a cab in Brooklyn around 1:30am to head to Penn Station.

I boarded an Amtrak to New London which got me there around 4:30 in the morning. 


A deserted train station.

I then slept on a bench until about 6:30, when my friends arrived and we boarded the ferry with their car in tow.

We visited Fishers in late September after the summer crowds had left the island.

And I’ve gotta say, it’s kind of a surreal experience.

We stopped at a local convenience store to load up on coffee and snacks, and you definitely get the vibe that the island is from a different era.

It’s unlike any place I’ve visited. There’s an understatedness to the whole island, and if you’re an outsider? You kind of feel like an outsider.

When we arrived at the Club, there were hardly any people there and the skies were a dark grey overcast. Not exactly what you hope to see when playing an oceanside bucket list course. Little did we know what we were in for.

Playing Fishers Island Club

Fishers Island Club is often touted as one of the most difficult tee times in the country to get. And it’s not hard to see why. Some well-known, top 100 courses feel kind of like a factory.

Merion is a great example. Merion is one of my all-time favorite courses, and days of golf. But it feels like the majority of the play on the East is guest play.

A place like Fishers on the other hand feels like a special place, that’s truly for their members. 


Fishers Island Club Eden
The wonderful Eden hole at Fishers Island.
I’ve even heard stories of them writing a letter to the editors of Golf Magazine asking to be removed from their top 100 list.

In 2021 it’s a little bit harder for any Club to stay under the radar, but they’ve done a pretty good job.

This is in large part due to the undertaking it takes to get there.

You’re not just going to swing by the club and take some photos from the outside looking in.

If you’re making it all the way out to Fishers Island, chances are, you’ve got a tee time.

Fortunately, that was the case for me. 

We played unaccompanied, didn’t set foot in the clubhouse, and due to the fog I’ll mention below, didn’t even really get to see that much of the course.


Yet it’s one of the most special days of golf I’ve ever had.

Fishers Island Club: The Course

Fishers Island was designed by Seth Raynor in 1926. It’s short by modern standards at a reasonable 6,556 yards, but this is just fine by me. As a 12 handicap, anything longer than that simply means my score will be that much higher.

It features many of the template holes that Raynor and his mentor C.B. Macdonald are known for, and in some cases, has some of the very best examples of these holes you’ll find in golf.

But when you head to the first tee and stare out at the first fairway, it all feels, well, very unassuming.

Looking out at the first hole, you’ll likely see what feels like a big (sometimes brown) field.

Fishers Island Club
The opening hole at Fishers.
There isn’t much in the way of fairway irrigation at Fishers, so you’ll often find some discoloration and firm, fast playing conditions.

To the point, I’ve heard people complain about the conditioning at the club.

Sure it might not be the tight lines and bright green you see when watching the Masters, but the approach to maintenance is very fitting with the course.

Understated.

Timeless.

A focus on how it plays over how it looks.

And believe me, you’ll have plenty of pretty things to look at when you’re playing a round at Fishers Island.

It’s also worth noting, the conditions were fantastic during our trip there.

Once you get to the second hole you start to get an idea of what’s to come.

You can see Long Island Sound out in the distance, and you’re treated to one of the most famous template holes: the Redan, modeled after the 15th at North Berwick.

The Redan at Fishers Island is much less severe than examples you might see at Yale, National, or Somerset Hills – but is still a great version of the hole.

Fishers Island Club
The redan.

And then as you make your way to the third green of the “Plateau” hole, you begin to see why Fishers Island has become so revered in the golf community. 

Fishers Island Club
“Plateau”
It isn’t due to an ostentatious clubhouse, tournament pedigree, or high price tag. 


In fact, I have zero clue how much it costs to be a member at the Club – but I’d guess it isn’t nearly as much as you’d think it is for a place of this stature.

But good luck getting an invite to join. 

No, what makes Fishers special is world-class Golden Age golf holes, set against a pristine, remote backdrop.

It’s like Mid Ocean Club on steroids. Who’d expect to see a course built by such a famous architect, in the 20s, on an island 600 miles from any other land?

Fishers, despite being closer to land, feels even more remote. And many of its holes, are even more impressive than those at MOC.

Five treats you to what might be the best biarritz hole I’ve ever played. Certainly the most beautiful.



The 7th, “Latimer” hole became a running joke with our group.


It’s a signature hole on a course full of signature holes, the running line became:

“Man, what an incredible Latimer hole this is. Best in the world.”

As far as I know, this is the only “Latimer” hole in the world.

Fishers Island Hole 7
You could argue the 7th “Latimer” hole is the Signature Hole at Fishers Island.



Speaking of best in the world, the “Double Plateau” 9th green is in the running for one my favorite greens in the world.

If you asked me to name my favorite, rapid-fire without thinking about it, this would likely be my answer.

Fishers Island Double Plateau
The 9th green, “Double Plateau.” I love this green so much.
As you make your way around Fishers you might find yourself occasionally feeling out of breath.

For what is a relatively flat island, there’s a surprising amount of elevation change on the course.

Much of this is brilliantly worked into the hole design, like on the wonderful 1oth “Knoll” hole with a steep walk up to the green.

Bad Weather at Fishers Island

Unfortunately, as you can tell from my photos of the day, the weather wasn’t on our side during my one visit here.

The plus is that it didn’t rain.

The minus is that, we couldn’t really see much. At all.

The exception was about a 30-minute window during our second round, where we saw some blue sky, and I was able to get great views of the 11th – 14th holes.

A look back at the 12th from the 14th green.


However, the fog did nothing to dampen our spirits.

After all, rounds like this don’t come around all that often (for most of us), so I was determined to enjoy every second of it.

Final Thoughts on Fishers Island

If I had to compare Fishers Island to one other course I’ve played, it would be Maidstone.

Obviously, this is another very exclusive place, but there are some similar vibes on the course.

Both are from a different era. They aren’t long. They’ve got some quirk to them. They’re ok if the fairways aren’t a lush green. They’ve got insane views. And despite very well-heeled memberships, everything on the course feels understated.


The “Cape” Hole.


With most rounds I play I feel like I can get excited for the next time I’ll be back.

But with Fishers Island? I legitimately don’t know if I’ll ever have the opportunity again.

It’s a small membership, it’s about as hard to get to as any course in America, and with so many people clamoring to play it these days, I imagine it will make opportunities to do so that much more difficult.

But I’m thankful for the chance I had to visit. 

Golf is such a special game. It takes you to places you’d never expect to visit with people you’d be unlikely to meet otherwise. 

Fishers Island Club
A foggy memory.


As I got in the car, and boarded the ferry, and waited for the train, and endured the 3 hour ride, and hopped on the subway to go back to Brooklyn – I thought about all of this.

About how a 24-hour whirlwind journey to a tiny island, thousands of miles from my home, to hit a little white ball around a waterfront field, became one of the most memorable days of my life.

And when you have the opportunity to visit Fishers Island Club? I imagine it will become one of the most memorable of yours as well.

Thomas Jr.,1927,Los Angeles (North),top100golfcourses,rev019_la_north_1,"The location for the Los Angeles Country Club makes it possibly one of the most valuable pieces of real estate in the world. It’s therefore fitting that the North course does full justice to the land because it is a truly magnificent layout.

The club was founded in 1897 as the Los Angeles Golf Club, moving locations three times before settling on its current site adjacent to Beverly Hills in 1911. The original club founders, Joe Sartori and Ed Tufts, along with Norman Macbeth and Charles Orr, laid out the inaugural course at the new Wilshire site.

The course (now known as the North) at the renamed Los Angeles Country Club was refashioned by Herbert Fowler in 1921 but re-routed in 1927 by George C. Thomas Jr. and his right-hand man, William Bell, with excellent effect. Fast-forward to the new millennium when Gil Hanse was entrusted to restore this classic course to its former glory.

The layout is at once thrilling and often exciting with its hills, ridges, swales and valleys. There are two 18-hole courses, the North and the South, if you can get a game, but only have time for one round, try and persuade your friendly member to play the North course.

There are far too many great holes to mention them all, but the par threes are exceptionally strong, exactingly long and noteworthy. The 7th is perhaps the toughest of them all, measuring almost 240 yards where only the perfect tee shot will find the sanctuary of the green. The 9th is perhaps the signature hole, with the clubhouse as the backdrop, but many members consider the 11th to be the star of the show with downtown LA as the backdrop.

As far as parkland courses go, Los Angeles North is as good as it comes. The course holds your interest all the way round and it’s a challenging and tough but fair layout. Roll this up with a beautiful setting (except perhaps for the odd imposing tower block) and you have a little piece of heaven."
20,Los Angeles (North),top100,"Los Angeles, CA",George C. Thomas Jr.,1927,"Los Angeles Country Club (Los Angeles, California)",Bill Satterfield,rev020_la_north_2,"Los Angeles Country Club is a historic club dating back to 1897 with the famous North course being developed in 1921. The club's first course was the 18 hole South course which ends up playing second fiddle to the championship North course. The USGA has begged LACC for years to host a U.S. Open or other major event but the elite membership has continually turned them down. The George Thomas design is first rate and features nice elevation changes while the William Bell bunkers are visually appealing yet still penilizing. It is a classic walkable course that represents one of the best parkland courses in America.

Individual Hole Analysis
Signature Hole:  11th Hole – 244 Yard Par 3 – Easily the signature hole of the course and one of the best par 3s anywhere. In fact, some years ago Golf Digest rated it the 23rd best par three in America.

11th Hole at Los Angeles Country Club (244 Yard Par 3)
Best Par 3:  11th Hole – 244 Yards – There is no arguing that the reverse Redan 11th at LACC is not only the best par 3 at the North course, but one of the best in the world. All the par 3s at Los Angles Country Club's North Course have a significant amount of length to them, but the 11th gives golfers the opportunity to fly the ball a shorter distance and utilize the slope that funnels into the green.

11th Hole at Los Angeles Country Club (244 Yard Par 3)
Best Par 4:  3rd Hole – 385 Yards – A barranca protects the left side of the hole and leads into a plateau portion of the very contoured fairway at this uphill hole. From there, an intimidating shot over a William Bell bunker that fronts of the green is required in order to find the putting surface. In the picture below you can see the Los Angeles skyline look back towards the tee box from behind the green.

3rd Hole at Los Angeles Country Club (385 Yard Par 4)
Best Par 5:  8th Hole – 561 Yards – A barranca disects the fairway and creates two separate alleys to play through. Given the angles of the fairway and placement of the trees, this hole becomes a true three-shot hole that features a cascading second fairway and 30 yard deep green. Utilizing the barranca throughout the design is one of Thomas' strong points at LACC and the golfer seems some of his best work at the 8th.

8th Hole at Los Angeles Country Club (561 Yard Par 5)
Birdie Time:  6th Hole – 340 Yard Par 4 – An excellent risk/reward opportunity is afforded to the golfer at the short 6th hole. A barranca encircles the green like a mote protecting a castle and strikes fear into the golfer banging on his driver in hopes of finding the green, or a short chip. The 90 degree dogleg right hole requires a 225 carry just to catch a view of the green on a safe line straight off the tee box. But the stories on this hole never have been told about the guy that took the safe line . . .

6th Hole at Los Angeles Country Club (340 Yard Par 4)
Bogey Beware:  13th Hole – 453 Yard Par 4 – At 453 yards this two-shotter protected by six bunkers is tough enough, but the real difficulty is the mental distraction the golfer has as he realizes the Playboy Mansion sits beyond the trees behind the green. Uphill all the way to the green, try to stay focused on the task at hand and not the distraction beyond the tall fence."
21,Pebble Beach,top100,"Pebble Beach, CA",Jack Neville/Douglas Grant,1919,PEBBLE BEACH - 18 POINTS,David Jones,rev021_pebble_1,"Trying to play golf at some of the best courses in America can be a frustrating experience. Yes, we all know that you can't get a round on Augusta but it seems there are more courses that you can't get a game on than you can. Pebble Beach therefore is a great exception - it's the top rated 'public' course in the USA and while it may be eye-watering expensive at least gives the chance to walk in the steps of legends that so many of us used to playing in Europe take for granted.

The practice putting green was running fast and true so expectations were high on the first tee. Our caddie tried to point me to the gold tees and my friend to the back blues due to our differing handicaps but call us old-fashioned, we decided to both play the same ones. The first hole was a massive disappointment. The fairway was very heavily sanded - and the green was a temporary! Bear in mind this was the most expensive round of golf I had ever paid for. No-one had told us about the condition of the course when booking or before teeing off - ludicrous. I would suggest anyone considering playing asks beforehand what condition the course is in........

The first few holes are nondescript and really do feel like any American country club course. Cart paths, roads and houses making up the most notable features. Now, I should say I played this course some years ago and probably hadn't read up on the course a huge amount before playing. Maybe I would have enjoyed it more with a little preparation but it was a little bit of an underwhelming start.

From there though as you go out to the water the holes are clearly special. The par 5 6th is intimidating on the tee but actually quite playable. By the time we got to the signature par 3 7th the wind was up and yardages were not really much use. A punchy knock down was the order of the day which my partner managed. I put a gap wedge in the air and paid the price as the wind brought it back into the sand. 8 is a fantastic hole - the approach shot over a canyon truly spectacular and the par I got there will stay with me for a long time. 9 and 10 both are wonderful holes, mainly because of the setting, before going back inland.

Golf World go behind the scenes at Pebble Beach Golf Links.

This stretch is probably better than the first few inland holes but you are back in a (very nice) housing estate. The green on the par 5 14th was a bit ridiculous - after coming 572 yards it is pretty small and very angled. 17 and 18 are simply a great finishing two holes and are well documented elsewhere! The wind was up and 17 was playing a rescue for me. 18 is just a wonderful walk up, spoilt for me by a 4 putt to shoot 92. Still, I was an 18 handicapper when I played there so 2 over handicap from the back tees at Pebble was satisfactory!

As an experience Pebble was pretty good. Everyone was friendly and the caddy just fine. The day was slightly spoilt by the sanded fairways and very inconsistent greens. Some were slow, some were fast and it was a question of having a guess when you got there.

But I couldn't help feeling that there wasn't as much 'special' at Pebble Beach as I had hoped for and seen in the true great courses. The holes on the ocean make the course, but the rest are at times nondescript. The round we had was a long one - almost 6 hours - and it felt like we were in a bit of a money-making machine.

Overall though I'm glad we played it. We enjoyed the views and there were some memories there to savour but I imagine there are courses with lesser reputations which will beat this when it comes to my all-time favourite courses. Still, at least you can get a round here without having to been one of the US elite so that's something.

 

BOOKING THE COURSE

Ah, welcome to the money making machine which is Pebble Beach.  Since I played there inflation has hit hard and the green fee for 18 holes at Pebble Beach is a staggering $625 plus cart fee and/or caddie fee. However, booking a tee time is far from straightforward for this much famed ‘public’ course. Because, you see, only guests of the hotel can book a tee time more than 24 hours out. Therefore if you want to guarantee a time on the course you need to stay there. Oh and there’s more, a minimum of a 2 night stay is required to book a round on Pebble – this rises to 3 nights at peak times. Now there are other courses there but given the cheapest room is normally around $1100 a night this is a fabulously expensive trip.

What I should say however, is that the rules seem to be broken. We called up about a week in advance and they gave us a tee time. Maybe that was because the course was pretty roughed up at the time and it would be harder in the peak months but it’s worth a go. You can get a sense of what availability looks like here.

TOUR TIPS

If you do make it to Pebble I would really encourage you to watch a few highlight reels from US Opens gone by to really appreciate the history as you go around. I visited in 1992 as a student when Tom Kite won in the winds and rain and it is just one of the many highlights from over the years worth having a look at.

We stayed in Carmel for a week and there is plenty to do around the area – great drives, the Monterey aquarium, amazing beaches. It’s only a couple of hours south of San Francisco but it was a few years ago now and much will have changed so instead of giving any real local tips, here’s some thoughts of other courses to play in the area..

The Links at Spanish Bay – Part of the Pebble Beach estate. We played it early one morning and it was a 14 at best. Lots of random red stakes everywhere and tight as anything. Avoid!!

Pacific Grove – A local course which I would play every time ahead of Spanish Bay. Can't complain at all for $35! The first 9 were nothing special but the condition was pretty good and pace of play not too bad. The holes were pretty short and very playable. The back 9 opened up on the ocean fantastically - really lovely holes that with the 40 mph wind were playing really tricky. I had a 360 yard drive on one par 4 to the green followed by 200 yards into the wind at the next."
22,Pebble Beach,top100,"Pebble Beach, CA",Jack Neville/Douglas Grant,1919,Review: Pebble Beach Golf Links,Andrew Harvie,rev022_pebble_2,"Given the high-profile nature of Pebble Beach Golf Links, it becomes difficult to present this review as anything other than a typical walkthrough of one of the three most famous golf courses in the world (alongside Augusta National and The Old Course). However, my first and only round at Pebble Beach in December 2023 left a lot to be uncovered by being on property. Sure, hundreds of rounds on my Playstation or Trackman, and the numerous US Open’s and the regular occurrence of the AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am yearly on the TOUR meant I knew ~roughly what I was getting into. Yet, the old Jack Neville and Douglas Grant design unveiled enough to make me compelled to write a good ‘ol fashioned review.

This opening hole, to such an esteemed golf course, is one that leaves quite a bit to be desired. In truth, it would be among the least exciting holes of any Top 20 golf course in America. A simple tee shot, with less-than-driver to the corner of this sub-400 yard par 4 from the back tees is a fairly mundane opening shot.


I did appreciate the approach shot’s difficulty given the short nature of the hole. Bailing out left off the tee means a longer shot, while everyone plays from a right-handed hanging lie. The greens at Pebble are notoriously small, and this one lives up the hype: not a lot of room for missing, but if you ought to miss, dumping it in the bunker right is the best play. I found this green to be relatively mush, but the back portion features a bit of interest.


Much is made about the dichotomy between the oceanside and inland holes at Pebble Beach, notably the sharp contrast in quality. Granted, it would be difficult for any golf course or property to follow up the stretch from the 4th through the 10th, but the 2nd is a standout inland. At 509 yards, this hole is a converted par 4 for the US Open, but for resort guests, a short par 5 awaits.


What TV won’t show you is the severity of this fairway, which slopes pretty hard towards the ocean on the right. Ideally, one aims at the right edge of the left bunker and gravity will take the ball to the centre. In my group, two people landed at the right edge of the right greenside bunkers (above) with a slight fade and they ended up in the bunkers on the right—cool!

For those laying up, it is a relatively straightforward shot as long as you play short of the (great hazard? Barranca?) trench running east-west on the line of play about 100 yards from the green.


Said trench from the layup area. The two cypress trees left and right make it a very precise layup, something I feel is missed in the modern game.


At 397 yards, the 3rd was the hole I was most curious about given how awkward it is on Trackman. A sharp dogleg left tumbling down the hill towards the ocean across that same trench/barranca, I found this to be a thrilling golf hole and woefully overlooked against the ocean holes. The tee shot tempts the golfer to smash it over the trees if possible, but if not, out to the right and having a hard approach shot from a very difficult downhill right-handed hook lie awaits.


What you have to negotiate with off the tee:


A fairly straightforward approach shot, if not for the difficult lie under the golfer’s feat awaits.


The 4th is the start of a brilliant stretch of oceanside golf, with the Pacific Ocean flanking the entire stretch from the 4th-10th on the right side. The 333 yard two-shot hole is shockingly uphill in person, and probably one of the biggest surprises against the preconceived notions of Pebble Beach prior to playing.


One thing that was disappointing is the mow lines following the US Women’s Open, which have been brought in from the left so that left pot-ish bunker is not a centreline bunker. The entire strategy of the hole benefits those playing out to the right closer to the ocean with the green canted to the right, but losing that fairway feels like a big miss. Nonetheless, a classy hole with a very uphill approach shot tough to control in the coastal winds.


Decent view from here, too:


The 189 yard par 3, 5th is a new Jack Nicklaus par 3, where the old hole played more directly towards the 6th tee. Essentially, you would play away from the ocean, rather than parallel to it as you do now. There are reverse redan elements, but I found this to be a bit of a letdown par 3 given how small the green is.


It is obviously an improvement over the old product… until you have to walk back to the 6th tee. However! The old hole looks rather, vanilla, so I can appreciate Jack’s interest in creating something unique, and I do think it has its own individualistic identity within the set of one-shot holes.

Beginning with the 498 yard par 5, 6th, the stretch ending at the 10th is likely the singular best four-hole stretch in golf. If it isn’t, I cannot wait to find it! When I played, the tee shot was slightly botched given the new mow lines make the ocean a long way right, but I was a bit surprised how narrow the chute between the bunkers and the Pacific was. A difficult tee shot, and one you NEED to get in the fairway.


TV cameras and video games do not do this second shot justice. It is so severely uphill it is hard to believe in person, and is a true thrill to hit in person. Hit and hope!


Here is a picture for scale of two average sized men:


The open nature of the green and the ground welcomes the running shot, meaning those going for it have the thrill of getting home in two looming over them with a good approach (if they can get it over the cliff).


The 107 yard par 3, 7th, in all its glory:


One thing about Pebble Beach that is somewhat of an annoyance is the green complexes. While they are small and that’s cool, there is very little contour in them, meaning a majority of the putts on any round are primarily flat. The same issue is prevalent at Bethpage Black, where the layout is absolutely awesome, but the green complexes are rather mundane and dare I say boring. If you expanded them out 20% and added a bit more contour in the spirit of the original golf course, I suspect Pebble would jump back into the Top 10 in the United States… likely where it belongs and should get back to.

At 416 yards, the 8th is a beefy golf hole given the forced layup of about 250 or so yards from the back tee. This is a difficult tee shot to figure out where to go, I know I had no idea. I hit it over the corner of the fescue on the left and was in the middle of the fairway, but with proper mow lines, the eye gets pulled pretty far right.


The approach to the 8th, as difficult as cool as advertised… and quite downhill.


For those laying up or unable to make it on the direct route, there is room left to bail out. The price of admission is worth it alone for this singular hole. Sublime!


A cool look back shows how dramatic the approach shot is:


The ninth hole is an absolute terror-infused 483 yards, with a very severe fairway waiting balls that land in the fairway. Anything between the bunkers on the left of the 9th fairway and the left edge of the bunkers in the distance at the 10th is a great line. Like the 6th and 8th, getting the ball in the fairway is paramount to the success of playing this hole properly. There are few golf courses that demand such accuracy, and the rough was not long!


From a right-handed hanging downhill lie, this is among the more difficult approach shots you will ever hit. That ocean might be out to the right, but it is MUCH more in play than it looks.


I wish I would have played the 444 yard par 4, 10th from the original tee down on the right, but I suspect that is likely frowned upon. Regardless, the 10th’s fairway is severely sloped to the right, rewarding a tee shot just right of the bunkers up the left. Another spectacular hole, but a (very) small step down against the 8th and 9th.


Another difficult approach from the consistent hanging lie, though this one has a bit of room to run the ball in, at least for those who challenge the ocean up the right.


I suggest taking a look back from behind the 10th green to admire the stretch of coastline golf you just played.


There is a fair amount of discourse about the merits of the 370 yard par 4, 11th and how it follows the stretch of golf along the coast, but I actually enjoyed this hole. Most great golf courses are anything but prototypical, and the 11th is that unusual spice that makes it what it is. A tee shot left of the mansion is ideal. For those keeping track, this is the third blind tee shot in four holes—I, for one, love the funk!


The severe uphill nature of the hole continues on the approach shot, and also plays to a severe back-to-front green. Finally, a green that makes me feel something!


The 12th is an abysmal 202 yard par 3. Playing slightly downhill, this… THIS, is the letdown after a pretty brilliant stretch of golf. I am not certain now anyone over a 3 index plays this hole, but good on you if you can. The green is likely too small and the sand splash coming from the bunker short left makes it borderline impossible to get it close without a 130 foot apex.


I loved the 401 yard par 4, 13th, another severe fairway but the first hole since the 3rd that it features a right-handed hook lie. I enjoyed the green here as well, with the back right portion being pretty demanding but the opening in the front allowing the higher-handicap to get it close. Anyways, from the back tee, getting it over the bunker jutting in on the left is not a cakewalk, so I imagine if the wind was different I would have to play out right and let the slope funnel the ball around the bunker.


A pretty neat, yet demanding uphill approach with everything dramatically sloping towards the Pacific Ocean on the left.


The 14th is a bit of a slog at 559 yards, turning uphill and to the right around the course’s boundary. The tee shot is unusual: unlike the 9th or 11th, where the achievement is simply avoiding choas on the opening swing, there are bunkers littering the landing area, meaning repeat plays are probably preferred to be able to figure out the exact line.


The aforementioned bunkers:


Good for you if you can get home in two here, most can;t, meaning this layup is rather lame.


The cypress tree on the right was a surprise, pushing most to the left of the fairway meaning the massive greenside bunker short left comes into play more. Kinda neat in that respect, but if you can get it down far enough, it doesn’t really matter. Even from the right, the false front right of the greenside bunker is equally as difficult.


I have a lot of time for the 393 yard par 4, 15th, a very fun tee shot to slam down the hillside with the bunkering up the left lingering.


The bunkering does make this a fairly difficult tee shot, but getting it down far enough means it likely won’t matter too much. I wonder if anyone has ever gotten into the greenside bunkers with their tee shots… I was about 65 yards from the front edge, and there are much longer players than me. I asked the two caddies in my group but they didn’t know. Someone call Kyle Birkshire!


The approach is relatively straightforward, but this is a subtle, good green.

I also loved the 400 yard par 4, 16th, which was likely the inland hole I was most excited to see prior to playing. Anything left of the Cypress Tree centre frame is ideal. The fairway does pinch pretty aggressively, so three wood or even less might be the play if it was firmer.


This approach shot is gorgeous, splitting the two cypress trees with some pretty artistic bunkering short.


If anything, I felt the famed 182 yard penultimate hole at Pebble Beach to be a slight letdown, mostly held up by history and its proximity to the Pacific Ocean. I think it’s a ~fine golf hole, but nothing more really. In general, the par 3’s at Pebble Beach are shockingly weak considering the status of the golf course, with only the 7th being a standout and largely off its location, not off its architectural merits.


The green’s shape was cool though!


The 18th was anything but a disappointment however, and a worthy finish to any golf course (but especially Pebble Beach). Credit where its due, English architect Herbert Strong extended the hole by some 200 yards, turning it into the par 5 it is today. At 541 yards, the hole is just reachable enough that playing closer to the Pacific means you might stand a chance at getting greenside in two, but just long enough that bailing out right makes it a tougher three-shot hole.


Anything left of the tree is pretty good. Missing right means you have to negociate with it (like I had to).


The green is small, but I think a good tee shot would allow the chance to get home in two if you were aggressive up the left. The bunkering against the sea wall makes the layup pretty awkward, especially trying to avoid the tree overhanging the right bunkers.


Is Pebble the single best public golf course in the United States? Probably not in my mind. For starters, the green complexes, especially in contrast to a Pinehurst No. 2 or Pacific Dunes, are lacking and among the top 20 golf courses in America, likely the least interesting set around. With that being said, it might be the most exciting golf course I’ve played tee-to-green, and for that, Pebble still deserves the utmost recognition among the world of golf.

Lots has been made about the price of a green fee here, and more specifically, if it is worth it. AT $625 USD, I would say yes, but if the rumours are true about the $1,000 green fee in 2025, likely not at that rate, especially if I could, in theory, play all five golf courses in two days at Bandon for that price (first round full price, second round half, third round free).


With all that being said, Pebble Beach is still epic, but I wish Pebble Beach Company would explore a restoration to bring back some of the classic features lost. If that happened, who knows how high Pebble would rank… for now, I think it is on the outside of the top 10-15 looking in."
23,Pinehurst (No. 2),top100,"Village of Pinehurst, NC",Donald Ross,1907,Pinehurst No. 2: Donald Ross’ Crowning Achievement,Sean Ogle,rev023_pinehurst_1,"I thought my golf season was over for the year – or at least the quest for top 100 courses.

That is until I got an email inviting me to a business conference in Charlotte, North Carolina in October.

It’d prove to be easy to tack onto the end of my trip to New York City, so I figured why not.


Of course, that easy two days quickly devolved into a full week after I realized that Pinehurst was a short 2 hour drive from where I’d be staying.

Simply put Pinehurst #2 is one of the most famous and history-rich courses in the world. It’s hosted nearly every major tournament and considering both the men and women’s US Opens were played just a few months before, it seemed like the perfect time to make the trip over.

I honestly wasn’t totally sure what to expect. I’d only played a couple rounds of golf ever in the Southeast, and I really knew nothing about what the town would be like.

The night before I was to switch over to my room at the Carolina Hotel I was at the Best Western in Southern Pines. A perfectly fine hotel for those on a budget, but it simply didn’t compare to what I’d soon be experiencing at the Carolina.

It was a short 10 minute drive to get to Pinehurst, but once there it felt a world away.  I was leaving strip mall central and then winding my way through neighborhoods trying to find the hotel.

Then out of nowhere I took a left hand turn and was greeted by the famous “Pinehurst” shrub in front of the hotel.

Carolina Hotel


Sidenote: There must be a higher concentration of golf courses within 20 minutes of Pinehurst, than anywhere else in the world. They. Are. Everywhere.

For some reason I had it in my head that the resort would be a little more like Bandon in the sense that once you’re in the resort, you’re in. Not the case. The resort and courses of Pinehurst seamlessly blend in with the small community around it – if I had to draw a comparison, it was probably more similar to Blackwolf Run and Kohler than any of the other golf destinations I’ve been to.

I got checked into the beautiful hotel, and was greeted with extraordinarily friendly service everywhere I went (must be a southern thing).

I hopped the shuttle to make the short transfer over to the main clubhouse where courses #1-5 sat.

Walking through the clubhouse was like getting a history lesson, seeing the photos, memorabilia and everything else that goes along with having so much history attached to the place.

After checking in and walking out of the pro shop, I strolled around the back of the clubhouse taking it in. The putting green, the Payne Stewart statue, the first tee.

Anytime I play a new course, especially one as highly revered as Pinehurst #2, you can’t help but get a little giddy.

I’ve traveled all over the world, and while I won’t say I’m jaded by any means, I have found that playing a new course like this gets me more excited than just about anything else.

I can only imagine how it’ll feel once I finally get to play the likes of Augusta or Cypress 🙂

I also learned that Pinehurst is actually a country club. I didn’t realize that there was a membership component to the course, but it was pretty clear it was due to the “members only” section of the deck at the back of the clubhouse.

I hit the range and then headed to the practice green where I met the three other guys I’d be playing with.  One of them was a sales guy and a pretty decent golfer. The other two were separate clients he’d just signed – and neither of them looked like they’d played golf in years – if ever.


At least I wouldn’t be the worst person on the course today, I thought to myself.

Little did I know just how special of a day it would end up being.

The Front Nine at Pinehurst No. 2

The other gentlemen I was playing with elected to take a cart, which I thought to be the stupidest decision of all time.

You’re playing #2 for the first (probably only) time ever, and the course is cart path only. So not only do you spend just as much (if not more) time walking than me, but you miss out on a large part of the experience.

I elected to take a caddie, which I rarely do if I don’t have to, but I felt it only appropriate. And it was a great decision, as he was excellent, and easily shaved some strokes off my round.

Hole 1 (Par 4, 375 yards)

Not wanting to embarrass myself, I left the driver in the bag and stepped up to the tee with my three wood, the length on the first isn’t it’s major defense.


Right down the middle.

The hole is deceptively difficult as the fairway closes with bunkers right around the landing area.  As was the case with many of the courses I played in the region, all the bunkers on the course were played as waste bunkers -and thus, you could ground your club.

I left my 6 iron to 15 feet, and as I walked up to the green I could see exactly what made this course so famous – and diabolical. The entire outside of the green sloped from the center out. Meaning, if you didn’t hit your spot – you’re screwed.

I asked my caddie if all the greens were this tough and he just said “psh, this an easy one.”

Great.

I walked off feeling ecstatic about me par.

Pinehurst 2 - Hole 1


Hole 2 (Par 4, 410 yards)

The second is one of the most difficult holes on one of the most difficult courses you’ll find.

During the open it could stretch to over 500 yards…as a par 4.

It’s far too easy to find yourself in the trees or the waste bunker on the left off the tee, and if you are you’ll have a tough time making par.

Pinehurst 2 - Hole 2 Pinehurst 2 - Hole 2 Approach


Hole 3 (Par 4, 317 yards)

I really liked the third hole.

A short par 4 with a dogleg right to an elevated green. However, take one look at the green complex, and you’ll be intimidating.

The green is narrow and wide, and it just looks like it slopes off in every direction.

I knew that I’d be having the golf gods looking down on me during the round after I left my approach in the right bunker, then hitting out of the san my ball hit the pin and dropped down to a foot away – allowing me to save my par.

Pinehurst 2 - Hole 3


Hole 4 (Par 5, 482 yards)

There was a little confusion on the course as to whether the 4th was a par 4 or par 5. The reality is that for the championships it was changed from a par 5 to a par 4. And the 5th was changed from a par 4 to a par 5.

I’m still not sure what this one technically was when I played it…

Either way, despite radically different scenery, this hole reminded me of the 14th at Trump International. It’s obvious which one would have influenced the other, but with the tee position, elevation, and bunkering there were many resemblances.

The main defense here was a tricky green that sloped hard right to left.

Pinehurst 2 - Hole 4 Pinehurst 2 - Hole 4 Approach


Hole 5 (Par 4, 431 yards)

Long known as one of the most fearsome par 4s in the game, I found it to be a very tame par 5.

Note: We played this around 480 yards, and I believe as a par 5. However, I’m still unsure…

This would be true for many of the par 5s at Pinehurst #2 actually.

I recently heard Tiger Woods talking about how the course is a great example of a course that can be tremendously difficult for the pros, but still totally playable for the amateur.

I won’t lie, the course was not nearly as difficult as I was expecting it to be – playing from the white tees of 6300 yards. Yes the greens were pretty intimidating, but I was able to go for it in 2 on nearly all of the par 5s – which I wasn’t expecting.

After leaving my approach 3 wood short in the bunker, I chipped it up to 10 feet and left myself with another tap in par. Something that was a bit of a theme for the first half of the round.

Pinehurst 2 - Hole 5


Hole 6 (Par 3, 179 yards)

The 6th is a long par 3 with a large green and two massive waste bunkers on either side of it. One cool feature is the fact that the tee box backs up right against the new back teebox for #4. Looking down the 4th fairway from there really puts into perspective how much longer the course can be when the pros play it.

Pinehurst 2 - Hole 6


Hole 7 (Par 4, 377 yards)

The 7th is a sharp dogleg right, and depending on where you put your drive, you can have a considerable carry over the waste bunkers at the corner. These were all new during the recent renovation, and my short 3 wood wasn’t nearly enough to even get close to thinking about making it over any of them off the tee.

With wider fairways than it used to have, driver may have been the play – but either way I still walked away with a solid par.

Pinehurst 2 - Hole 7 Approach Small

Fun fact: There’s a HUGE house on the 7th fairway that is owned by the CEO of a Fortune 500 company. My caddie said the place get’s used once a year at most. More interesting than that though is the fact the guy bought part of the outfield wall from Yankee Stadium and it now sits in his driveway.

I couldn’t help but sneak over to take a photo…

D71_8224


Hole 8 (Par 5, 457 yards)

The par 5 8th is another example of a par 5 that just seemed way too easy. It only measured 456 yards, and was basically just a straight shot uphill to the green.

At this point I had a pretty good score going, and I left my second shot just short of the green and proceeded to three putt it from there. I still made par, but being that close on a par 5 and not walking away with better was frustrating.

Pinehurst 2 - Hole 8


Hole 9 (Par 3, 151 yards)

For some reason this was the hole that’s always stuck out in my mind.  The par 3 9th was the one that I was most excited to play, and walking up to it, I was also only three over and feeling pretty great about the round so far.

It’s not a long hole at only 148 yards from where we were, but the bunkering and green undulation is easily some of the most severe you’ll see on the course.

I stepped up, hit my shot, and I swear I thought it was going to go in the hole. It was right in line with the pin, and it looked like a tap in birdie from the tee.

The reality was it was about 10 feet out, and I missed the putt – but once again, I’ll take tap in pars all day long on a course like this.

Pinehurst 2 - Hole 9 Small


The Back Nine at Pinehurst No. 2

Hole 10 (Par 5, 469 yards)

This is another example of someone up above looking down on me. As I made the turn with a 39 on the front, I couldn’t help but say to myself “how cool would it be to break 80 on Pinehurst #2?!”

I stepped up to the tee of what ended up being another remarkably short dogleg left par 5, and what did I do? Duck hooked it, hard into the trees to the left.

As I turned around to walk back, my caddie just starts laughing.

“Clean living, man.”

“What?”

“Your ball hit the tree and bounced back out to the middle of the fairway”

My second shot was a three wood just to the right of the green and I chipped up and two-putted for par.

It’s worth noting some of these holes play much longer if you step back to the blue tees, in this case it would be a 100 yards farther back…

Pinehurst 2 - Hole 10


Hole 11 (Par 4, 368 yards)

Ben Hogan reportedly called the 11th one of his favorite par 4s, and with the recent restoration, it was restored to the way it looked and played back in his day.

A mid-length to long par 4 (depending on the tees), it has a feature found on many of the holes at Pinehurst #2 in that the green is just slightly off center of the fairway. You rarely have a straight shot to the green.  It’s often slightly off to the right, and surrounded by bunkers, forcing you to think a little bit more about what shot you’re going to hit.

They’ve added waste bunker all down the right, and while it was relatively tame during my time there, I can only imagine how scary they let it get for the majors.

Pinehurst 2 - Hole 11


Hole 12 (Par 4, 351 yards)

Remember that slightly off-center green we talked about at 11? Well, 12 has the same thing, but much more pronounced.

Ideally, you’ll want to find the right side of the fairway for the shortest approach. Be careful not to go long on that shot either, because the back of the green has a pretty tight lie and significant run off the back – as I learned the hard way.

I had my first double in awhile, and I could slowly feel the round slipping away from me.

Pinehurst 2 - Hole 12 Green

Hole 13 (Par 4, 356 yards)

I found 13 to be a welcome change of pace.

So far the back nine had been great, but 13 added a little bit of elevation and visual interest to the course.



A dogleg right with a significantly elevated green that sweeps back a bit to the left, this hole had a little hint of Tobacco Road in it which I really enjoyed.

Pinehurst 2 - Hole 13

Hole 14 (Par 4, 400 yards)

It was right around this time that we realized just how slow we’d really been playing.  Our caddie told us we had about an hour of light left, and honestly, at that point I was about ready to forge ahead from my group (as there was no one in front of us anymore).

But we all agreed to pick it up a bit, and I crossed my fingers.

14 is one of those holes where you really feel like you can step up and rip it. It’s a straightaway par 4, but as with many of the holes, you need to be wary of bunker outcroppings around the landing area.

Pinehurst 2 - Hole 14



Hole 15 (Par 3, 169 yards)

The first par 3 on the backside, the 15th is a straight forward par 3 with a large round green, and some deep menacing bunkers flanking it. However like most of the holes here, Ross’ signature crowned greens are in full force, waiting to knock your ball off the dance floor.

Overall with the exception of #9, I was slightly underwhelmed by the par 3s on the course. Sure, there was nothing wrong with them, but I felt they lacked a bit of interest and wow factor.

Pinehurst 2 - Hole 15



Hole 16 (Par 5, 469 yards)

Ok, now these par 5s are getting a little ridiculous. Either that, or I’m just playing from the wrong tee boxes. This one comes in at 456 yards, and I believe is the first and only time that water comes into play on the course.

In two shots I’m just off the green, and after a tumultuous couple holes before it, I make my par and walk away.

This actually played as a par 4 during the US Open, and at 489 yards, is just 3 yards shorter than the blue tees which play it as a par 5.

Pinehurst 2 - Hole 16

Hole 17 (Par 3, 155 yards)

At this point it was near dark, and we were hurrying to get the round in. I don’t know if it was the light or Donald Ross playing tricks on us, but no one could seem to dial it in to get the right distance on this hole.



Pretty much anywhere not on the green is in trouble.

Pinehurst 2 - Hole 17

Hole 18 (Par 4, 382 yards)

What’s there to say about #18? Well, I’m not totally sure, as I could barely see it when I played 🙂

I will say walking down the 18th fairway to where Payne Stewart made that championship-winning putt in 1999 was a pretty remarkable feeling. You can clearly imagine all of the grandstands, and cheering, and I imagine no matter how many times you play it – it would never get old.

I ended up having a 12 foot putt to save par, and tie the best round of my life with an 81.

In near darkness, I stepped up to the ball, visualized my line, and rolled it in, completing what is easily one of the most memorable rounds of my life.



Pinehurst 2 - Hole 18

Final Thoughts on Pinehurst #2

Despite not being in love with the par 3s, I actually liked the course more than I was expecting to.

I can hear you now “It’s ranked so high, and has so much history! How could you expect not to like it?”

I’ve come to find, that it’s rarely the classic, championship, true-test-of-golf courses that are my favorites.

Why?

Well for one, because they’re hard!

But on top of that, I like holes that are memorable, quirky, unique, and most importantly fun.


Many courses similar to Pinehurst (Oakland Hills, Olympic Club, etc.) are incredible to play because of the history and prestige but don’t have quite the same wow factor as some other courses.

With all of that said, I thoroughly enjoyed Pinehurst #2. It lived up to expectations, and the greens were honestly unlike anything I’ve ever seen before. Luckily my speed was pretty much on for the day, as I only had one birdie, but numerous tap in pars.

Simply put, this is a pilgrimage every golfer has to make at some point in their lives. Is it a cheap round? Absolutely not. Is it one you and your buddies will talk about for the rest of your lives? You bet.

And luckily, even though this round may very well be the most expensive one of your life, Pinehurst Resort has 8 other incredible courses that are each unique, more affordable, and potentially, even more enjoyable as a recreational golfer."

From being the cradle of American golf to Payne Stewart’s famous U.S. Open win to being the first course to host the men’s and women’s U.S. Open back to back, the No.2 course at Pinehurst is a bucket list course for any golf aficionado. No.2 features some of the strongest shot values on the planet and there is no part of your game that it doesn’t test. From punishing length to deadly accuracy to exacting finesse, you have to have your ‘A’ game going all day to conquer the mighty No.2. Its famous domed greens look big, but the effective landing areas are small with the slightest miscalculation being punished to the fullest extent of the law. If there is some forgiveness to be had it is off the tee as the fairways are more generous now than before the Coore & Crenshaw renovation. Instead of the thick rough found in the previous century, fairways were expanded and waste areas were exposed outside of the short grass. When the course is running firm though, the lack of rough can result in precarious lies where luck is the biggest factor after a ball chases through the fairway. There isn’t a lot of movement in the terrain at No.2 except for a brief stretch on each nine, which is nice for walking but not quite as engaging while playing. Speaking of walking, there are no carts on No.2 with players being required to walk with, or without, a caddie. Ultimately Pinehurst rides its history to its lofty rankings on the major magazines lists, but is still worth dropping the coin on for one loop around while making sure to take some of the resort’s other courses in as well.

Individual Hole Analysis
Signature Hole:  18th Hole – 451 Yard Par 4 – Standing on the final tee at Pinehurst there is a lot going on. There is the emotion of playing the last hole of the day, the challenge of a 451 yard uphill two-shotter, the history of those that have come before you, and tons of trouble to find as a massive waste bunker crosses in front of the tee and works its way up the right side. Bunkers provide a wall of defense in front of the elevated green and demand a high, soft approach shot. The 18th hole is a perfect example of what Pinehurst is all about. Demanding, yet fair, tee shots followed up by a more demanding approach shot. #2 is simply a shot makers course, which by #18 you will be well aware of!

18th Hole at Pinehurst Resort No.2 (451 Yard Par 4)
Best Par 3:  9th Hole – 191 Yards – When you come to Pinehurst you should have one expectation above anything else; challenging greens. The course that is perhaps the most demanding approach shot course in the world boasts green complexes that will test every aspect of your short game and the 9th is a good example of it. The right third of the green slopes off the edges while the rest of the green is mostly surrounded by bunkering. Anything that doesn't find the putting surface will require exacting work to save par. The long, thin bunker short of the right side is a lousy spot to be if the pin is on the left third of the green as it leaves an awkward distance to hit precisely from the sand. This hole is one of the most striking visual holes since the restoration.

9th Hole at Pinehurst Resort No.2 (191 Yard Par 3)
Best Par 4:  8th Hole – 502 Yards – A very strong two-shotter, the 8th plays as a par four from the tips and a par five from the closer tees. The tee shot plays from a natural rise in the terrain down to a sunken fairway before climbing back up to the raised greensite. Tee shots up the left side that bring the trees into play but can be rewarded with a speed slot that will generate some extra distance. The classic Ross domed green here makes it difficult to get close to the flag, especially if you are trying to get close to a rear pin placement when balls can trickle off the back and leave a brutal up and down scenario. While the front of the green is open for approaches on the ground or in the air, it is one of the most challenging greens to hit in regulation and a cracker of a hole.

8th Hole at Pinehurst Resort No.2 (502 Yard Par 4)
Best Par 5:  5th Hole – 576 Yards – For years the 5th hole at Pinehurst #2 was one of the most celebrated par fours in North Carolina, and with good reason. However, the hole played as a par five in the original design and up until the 1951 Ryder Cup when it was converted to a brutal two-shotter. It was lengthened and reintroduced as a par five leading into the 2014 U.S. Opens while the 4th hole, formerly a par five, was reduced to a par four. This big par five doglegs to the left around a waste area while trees line the right side. The fairway slopes from right to left and it will take about 300 yards to clear the bunker on the left side if you try to shorten the hole. The green complex is one of the most brilliant designs anywhere and requires absolute precision when playing it. The edges around the green are quick to repel shots that don't approach with sufficient energy and bunkers lie in wait to create more grief. From the lower bunker on the left there is hope of getting up and down with a spinning sand shot that makes it high enough onto the putting surface to hold, but from the high bunker on the right it will take Tour level skill to get up and down. There are no pin placements within seven paces of the perimeter of the green due to the severity of the slope and it will take all of your game and strategy to come out on top here.

5th Hole at Pinehurst Resort No.2 (576 Yard Par 5)
Birdie Time:  3rd Hole – 387 Yard Par 4 – There are plenty of punishing holes at Pinehurst, so taking advantage of this early gift is paramount. The hole plays across flat ground to a generous fairway where only 250 yards is needed to stay short of the fairway bunker on the right and set up a wedge into the green. Aggressive players may try to clear the fairway bunkers and drive it up to a chipping area left of the green. The green isn't as severe as others on the course so players can attack pins with more confidence. During the 2014 U.S. Open this hole yielded more birdies than any other, except for the par five 4th (which used to be a par four).

3rd Hole at Pinehurst Resort No.2 (387 Yard Par 4)
Bogey Beware:  4th Hole – 529 Yard Par 4 – Donald Ross said that championship golf courses, like Pinehurst #2, should “call for long and accurate tee shots, accurate iron play, precise handling of the short game, and finally, consistent putting.” To walk away with a par at the lengthy second hole, at least three of those elements better be spot on. Played as a par five prior to the 2014 U.S. Open, the 4th now stands as Pinehurst's most difficult par four. Tipping out well over 500 yards, the 4th plays from an elevated tee to a fairway that steadily turns to the left the entire way to the hole. Waste bunkers are found randomly along the outside of the fairway in conjunction with the 1940s version of the hole and more bunkers are featured left and right of the green. The putting surface tilts hard right to left and acts as the hole’s biggest defense; as if the length wasn't tough enough already. The swell in front of the green is a well used collection area for approaches that don't come in with sufficient juice to climb onto the putting surface. As a par five, it was a hole players looked at as a possible scoring opportunity; as a par four it is a bogey magnet."

A small membership that is the epitome of ""historic old school"" is what you'll find here with members who know the game, respect the game, and honor its history. There isn't a country club feel at CGC, it is akin to San Francisco Golf Club where it is all about golf. Players walk, take a caddie, and soak in some of the best template holes that C.B. Macdonald ever created, including a set of par threes that only Camargo can rival as the best the Good Doctor ever carved out of the ground. Speaking of the ground, the terrain at CGC is mostly flat with subtle changes throughout the property along the same lines as Kingston Heath and Garden City Golf Club. Despite the flatness, there is no lapse of interest given the brilliance of the architecture, bunker placements, and shaping throughout the putting surfaces. The course length is modest by today's standards tipping out under 6900 yards, but no one at the club is concerned with that; in fact, many members choose to play the middle tees to most closely replicate the experience Macdonald had when he designed the course. The historic club is no stranger to hosting high profile events having welcomed the world's best players for the U.S. Open in 1897, 1900, and 1911 while more recently hosting the Women's Senior U.S. Open in 2018. Chicago Golf Club has also hosted the Walker Cup in 1928 and again in 2005 but has hosted more amateur tournaments than anything else with the U.S. Amateur in 1897, 1905, 1909, and 1912 as well as the Women's U.S. Amateur in 1903 and U.S. Senior Amateur in 1979. Ultimately, an invitation to Chicago Golf Club is an opportunity to be cherished and an experience never to be forgotten.

Individual Hole Analysis
Signature Hole:  3rd Hole – 219 Yard Par 3 – The one-shotters at Chicago Golf Club are of the highest caliber and none are finer than the first; the famous Biarritz. Pin positions are only found in the back third which is perfect considering how well the superintendent maintains nearly ideal firm and fast conditions. After carrying the bunker fronting the target, the tight grass leading up to the putting surface is deft at skipping balls through the chasm and on top of the green where the flag awaits. The green complex is encircled by bunkers and creates a virtual island green, however the sand is shaped thinly enough that big misses will finish in the rough or perhaps in the tree line on the left that creates the club's eastern boundary near the southern end of the property. During a golf tournament, you'd have a hard time dragging me away from watching shot after shot comes into this masterful hole.

3rd Hole at Chicago Golf Club (219 Yard Par 3)
Best Par 3:  7th Hole – 207 Yards – The template hole I see copied more than any other, but rarely nearly as well as what is found at CGC, is Redan. This fantastic rendition boasts a very large putting surface and an obvious slope that is anxious to work your ball toward the flag that will always be found on the left half of the putting surface. With the firm conditions, a very viable play is to hit a low running shot that carries the bunker in front before ascending up the face of the green before swinging left in classic Redan fashion. As is always the case with a good Redan, the bunker fronting the green and angling left with the putting surface is a death trap with a steep face that you want to avoid at all costs. After playing this wonderful and pure rendition of a Redan, you will likely find yourself shaking your head trying to figure out what Tom Doak and Jim Urbina were thinking when they designed their version of Redan as the 12th hole at Old Macdonald; perhaps the worst hole at the entire Bandon Dunes Resort.

7th Hole at Chicago Golf Club (207 Yard Par 3)
Best Par 4:  12th Hole – 462 Yards – I've never played a Punchbowl hole I didn't like, and the 12th at Chicago Golf Club is no exception. Five fairway bunkers are scattered across the short grass enroute to the green which is certainly a factor to consider given how important the second shot is here. Approaches coming in from the left side are ideal as they avoid the deep bunker at the front right of the green while also taking advantage of the slope in the putting surface that can be quick to feed balls near the hole given the drainage slope out the back right. Like most Punchbowl holes, the second shot is coming in from a longer distance than most second shots given the generous sloping of the green and puts a premium on accuracy with those clubs in your bag as missing the putting surface is a costly mistake. The best and most fun hole on the back nine, it is great to see some modern courses implementing Punchbowl designs that embrace the elements CGC shows here.

12th Hole at Chicago Golf Club (462 Yard Par 4)
Best Par 5:  4th Hole – 536 Yards – One of only two par fives at the course, Long is considered one of two Cape holes at CGC (14th is the other) though the turn left is fairly slight, but does feature a large boomerang bunker and waste area on the inside of the turn that you'll want to avoid. While the green can be reached in two, it takes a very precise shot in order to clear the false front but not come in so hot that your ball feeds off the back into the horseshoe bunker hugging the putting surface. The elevated green represents one of the largest rises on the property and a moment where a decision has to be made in calculating the firmness of the ground with the slope that wants to repel shots that come up wanting. Even laying up doesn't guarantee a chance to go flag hunting unless it is positioned in the center of the green, because that is the only safe place to aim on this challenging putting surface. Ultimately, this is a high quality par five and an example of what can be done with relatively tame property to work with.

4th Hole at Chicago Golf Club (536 Yard Par 5)
Birdie Time:  5th Hole – 358 Yard Par 4 – Midway through each nine Macdonald offers a short par four to try and take advantage of. On the back nine it is the 351 yard Cape hole with a narrow entrance into the green, and on the front it is the 358 Leven hole. As is typical with Leven holes, a heroic carry is required off the tee for the optimal angle into the green, but here at Chicago Golf Club that carry isn't as challenging as it was originally as the angled cross bunker on the right side requires just 240 yards to clear from the back tee and less than 200 yards from the middle tee. The right half of the green is unobstructed for a shot to run up onto the putting surface while the left side has a bunker that must be flown. Interestingly, the spine in the middle of the green can dictate which side of the fairway you want to attack from and which half of the putting surface to finish on. With the prevailing Chicago winds likely at your back, this is a great opportunity to take a rip at the green and show off your short game to complete the birdie.

5th Hole at Chicago Golf Club (358 Yard Par 4)
Bogey Beware:  2nd Hole – 481 Yard Par 4 – The Road hole is often the most difficult par on a template course and Chicago Golf Club is no different. Within 20 yards of being a 500 yard par four, the 2nd hole will require length and accuracy in order to put up a fair fight. Four fairway bunkers line the left side and creep further toward the center line the farther down the fairway you get. Those bunkers influence golfers to attack the right side of hole, which is the optimal angle into the green, but total precision is needed to make it work as it is easier to end up in the right rough than it is the short grass when carrying the lone bunker on that side. The false front on the right side is ready to deny shots that approach the green with insufficient energy and on the left of course awaits the infamous Road bunker where par saves are few and far between. CGC is known for its difficult starting stretch, and this hole is a key reason why."
26,Chicago GC,top100,"Wheaton, IL","C.B. Macdonald, 1895/Seth Raynor, 1923",1895,Chicago Golf Club,top100golfcourses,rev026_chicago_gc_2,"It’s possible that Chicago acquired its “Windy City” nickname thanks to the cooling summer lake breezes, which funnel their way through the city streets, and it’s also feasible that the great World’s Columbian Exhibition of 1893 was the catalyst for the formation of Chicago Golf Club. After all, the city needed a golf course for the visiting VIPs.

Founded in 1892, Chicago Golf Club was initially located at Belmont. In 1894 it moved to its present location at Wheaton and it became the first 18-hole course in America, designed by the daddy of American golf course architecture, Charles Blair Macdonald.

Chicago Golf Club has a number of firsts to write home about. In 1897 it was the first club outside the Northeast to host the US Open and it was also the first club to employ bent grass greens. Chicago was also one of the five founder members of the American Golf Association, which was subsequently renamed the USGA. The other four charter members were: Newport Country Club, Shinnecock Hills Golf Club, St. Andrew's Golf Club (Yonkers, N.Y.), and The Country Club.

George Bahto commented as follows in The Evangelist of Golf : “Macdonald’s original design was not dramatically altered for over 20 years with the exception of a few suggestions by famed British architect Harry Colt. With new and better courses popping up all the time, the architect of Sunningdale, at the club’s request, tweaked the design to help keep the quality of the course competitive with some of the more modern layouts. Ultimately though, Chicago Golf Club’s design became antiquated and the club voted in 1922 to retain Macdonald’s legendary protégé, Seth Raynor, to assist Macdonald in completely remodeling the layout.”

The club staged many early championships, including the US Amateur, US Open and the Walker Cup. In 1928, Bobby Jones was the Walker Cup playing captain and he posted an amazing course record 66, which drove team USA to an emphatic 11-1 victory. The Walker Cup returned to Chicago for the second time in 2005.

Chicago Golf Club is one of America’s most exclusive golf clubs and today it is still intensely private, but if you’ve been lucky enough to play this famous course, we’d love to read your review."
27,Riviera,top100,"Pacific Palisades, CA",George Thomas Jr./Billy Bell Sr.,1927,A George Thomas Classic: Riviera,Andy Johnson,rev027_riviera_1,"Riviera Country Club, one of America’s iconic golf courses, is tucked away in a residential area off the busy Sunset Boulevard. The course sits in a small canyon, a relatively unpromising site where, in 1927, George C. Thomas, Jr., laid out his masterpiece. Thomas was a member of the Philadelphia School of Architecture, and after building Whitemarsh Valley Country Club in his hometown, he decided to take his talents to California, where he ended up designing courses for Los Angeles’s three preeminent country clubs: Riviera, Los Angeles, and Bel-Air.

Since its inception, Riviera has been a fixture in tournament golf, serving as the annual venue for the Los Angeles Open (now known as the Genesis Invitational), the closing event of the PGA Tour’s West Coast swing. It has also hosted a handful of national championships, including the 1948 U.S. Open, the 1983 and 1995 PGA Championships, the 1998 U.S. Senior Open Championship, and the 2017 U.S. Amateur. In 2028, Riviera will host the Summer Olympics. The course at Riviera shows an architect at the height of his skill. The land is hardly awe-inspiring; George Thomas and his construction man William P. Bell were given a small, mostly flat property, and they didn’t move much dirt. Yet Thomas and Bell found all sorts of great natural hole concepts. At the Redan par-3 4th, for instance, they simply used the side of the canyon to create the slope necessary for their rendition of the template design.
Early photos of Riviera indicate that Thomas and Bell created a naturalized and rugged aesthetic that has been lost today, but the design is strong enough to shine with almost any presentation.

This overlay, created by Scott Griffith (@bottomgroove), demonstrates how Riviera has evolved over the years. Bill Coore and Ben Crenshaw worked on the bunkers in the early 90s and, most recently, Tom Fazio gave the bunkers and the barranca on 8th hole a facelift. These kinds of changes are likely to keep coming, as Riviera is one of the most visible and frequently discussed venues on the PGA Tour.
The course

Riviera has to be in the conversation as one of the best-designed golf courses in America. It tests all aspects of a player’s game and has no weak holes. The course is also incredibly treacherous. Television cameras can’t do justice to the depth of the bunkering. A mishit shot that finds a green-side bunker results in a genuine penalty, especially on the short side. Many thanks to Jon Cavalier (@linksgems) for contributing his photos to this profile.
Hole No. 1 – 503 yards – par 5  Set some 60 feet above the fairway, the 1st tee is where you “enter the canyon,” but not before your name is announced by the starter. This is one of Riviera’s distinctive traditions. Teeing off at a great course is already special, but the starter experience adds some butterflies to the experience. The 1st hole is more of a par 4.5 than a par 5, as a strong tee shot will leave a mere mid-iron into a boomerang green that wraps around a deep bunker. Long hitters may have to use a 3-wood to stay short of the crossing barranca, which gives the hole a Sahara or Great Hazard feel. The heavily sloped green presents the main challenge, setting the tone for the rest of the round.
Hole No. 2 – 471 yards – par 4  While the 1st offers a great birdie chance, the 2nd is as stout a par 4 as you will find in golf. The hole plays into the prevailing wind and slightly uphill, making its 471 yards feel more like 500. Your tee shot has to find the fairway if you want any chance finding the long, narrow green in two, as the kikuyu rough is a menace for long-iron shots. A bunker 40 yards short of the green threatens both lay-up and run-up attempts, but a well-placed approach can feed onto the two-tiered putting surface from a slope on the right side.
Hole No. 3 – 434 yards – par 4 The 3rd hole at Riviera is a mid-length par 4 that bends slightly to the right. A left-to-right tee shot will have the best chance of finding the narrow fairway, which is protected by trees on the left. The hole’s strategy is best understood from the green back. The right side of the putting surface is guarded by a deep bunker, and the left side slopes severely to the left. These characteristics of the green make playing from the left side of the fairway preferable, even necessary.
Hole No. 4 – 236 yards – par 3  Ben Hogan called the 4th at Riviera “the greatest par-3  hole in America.” High praise, for sure, but the hole lives up to it.

George Thomas employed the Redan template here and, as I mentioned above, did so in a natural way, using the slope of the canyon to create the shoulder that kicks well-placed shots toward the hole. The bunker that blocks the logical entrance to this long par 3 will force most players to go right and use that natural slope.
Hole No. 5 – 434 yards – par 4 Although overshadowed by more famous holes like Nos. 4, 6, 10, and 18, the 5th should be in the discussion as one of the finest par 4s in the world. The tee shot favors precision over power. There is plenty of room on the right side of the fairway, but an approach from there will be obstructed by a large mound. The ideal line, therefore, is up the left, but that play comes with its own risks, as the trees down that side can block you out if you’re a little too far left. The green has a spine running through it and a steep swale that gobbles up any approaches slightly right of target.
Hole No. 6 – 199 yards – par 3 One of the most photographed holes in golf, the par-3 6th features a small bunker in the middle of the green. This iconic bunker is one of three around this green: there’s also a large, deep front bunker and a nasty back bunker, which come into play for different pin positions. The putting surface has a great deal of back-to-front slope, making any putt from pin-high or above a challenge.
Here’s a view of the 6th hole you might not see very often: from a house behind and above the hole. It shows particularly well how strangely shaped the green is. Imitated, but never equaled.

Hole No. 7 – 408 yards – par 4 George Thomas was particularly adept at creating unique strategic challenges on his shorter par 4s. The 7th at Riviera is a good example. A massive bunker on the left and a barranca down the right require a precise tee shot. But what’s so clever about the design is that the more aggressive a you get with your drive, the more the fairway bunker cuts in. The prudent play may be to lay back with an iron, but the hole is short enough to be tempting. It begs you to try and thread the needle. Those who lay back will face a mid-iron approach to a small target. The 7th green is narrow and has bunkers on the right and a runoff area on the left. The putting surface itself is no picnic, either, with its severe back-to-front slope.
Hole No. 8 – 460 yards – par 4  In 2008, Tom Fazio’s firm completed what Riviera billed as a restoration of Thomas’s original split fairway on the 8th hole. Fazio’s work has perhaps brought back Thomas’s strategic intentions from tee to green, but in my opinion, Fazio butchered the green, which now stick out like a sore thumb. In general, the concept for the hole works better on paper than in practice. There just isn’t much of a reason to go left. From there, you’ll have a slightly better angle into the green, but the risk outweighs the potential reward. This is the one hole at Riviera that could use another round of tweaks.
Hole No. 9 – 458 yards – par 4 The front nine comes to a close with the spectacularly beautiful 9th, which gives players a full view of Riviera’s majestic clubhouse. The longish par 4 plays uphill, and the shallow green tends to reject any approaches not from the fairway. Players need to thread their tee shot between fairway bunkers on both the right and the left, and a good ball sets up a mid- to short iron to the elevated green. The toughest pin location is back left, behind a devilish green-side bunker.
Hole No. 10 – 315 yards – par 4 Riviera’s back nine opens with one of the most revered short par 4s in golf, where a 2 and an 8 are equally in play. On the tee, George Thomas tempts you to pull driver and aim for the pin. This shot is risky but, if well placed, can lead to an eagle look. The safe play is an iron to the far left side of the fairway, which sets up a straightaway wedge. Anything on the right side of the fairway is death; from that angle, the green is shallow and runs sharply away. When the turf is firm and fast, it’s nearly impossible to hold the green from anywhere right of the fairway’s center line. Similarly, if you find yourself in the right green-side bunkers, you’ll have trouble keeping your next shot on the putting surface. I have first-hand experience of this. I hit one of the greatest bunker shots of my life from there, and sure enough, when I got up to the green, I saw that my ball was five yards off the edge. The 10th hole is an enduring lesson that strategy and options, not length, are what make a hole both fun and challenging for the most- and least-skilled golfers alike.
Hole No. 11 – 583 yards – par 5 Following the unforgettable 10th is Riviera’s first par 5 since its opener. Here again Thomas employs a Sahara / Great Hazard-style barranca to keep the longest hitters in check. A tee shot that runs up to the edge of the hazard leaves about 270 yards to the green. Deep bunkering around the green once again emphasizes angles. While it’s tempting to attack the green after a good drive, any miss to the right will leave a dicey chip. The ideal landing zone for the second shot is short left, which opens up the green and makes for a relatively easy up-and-down birdie.
Hole No. 12 – 479 yards – par 4  After consecutive birdie opportunities, Riviera flexes its muscle with the demanding par-4 12th. The barranca cuts down the left side, and large eucalyptus trees stand along the right, making hitting the fairway essential to success. The ideal line is down the left center, which offers a good angle to attack a green guarded by a deep front bunker and the barranca gorge.
Hole No. 13 – 459 yards – par 4 In response to flooding issues, the club modified the par-4 13th by planting massive eucalyptus trees along the left side of the fairway to soak up water. These trees have taken away some of the original design’s luster, but 13 remains a great hole. The tee shot requires a right-to-left ball flight, especially from those who reach for driver. On approach, you will have to think about the barranca left and long and the deep bunker to the right.
Hole No. 14 – 192 yards – par 3  The thrilling back-nine run takes a breather with the relatively benign par-3 14th, which features an extremely wide and shallow green. The key here is distance control, as any miss long or short-sided will make for a tough up-and-down on a green running hard from right to left and back to front.
Hole No. 15 – 492 yards – par 4  It doesn’t get much attention, but the 15th is one of the most striking holes at Riviera. This long, demanding par 4 calls for a left-to-right tee shot that avoids the deep fairway bunker on the right. A good drive leaves a long to mid-iron into a Biarritz-like green. Each shot needs to be well struck and well placed.
Hole No. 16 – 166 yards – par 3 With pressure mounting down the stretch, players confront a test of nerves at the beautiful, exacting par-3 16th. You need full trust in your yardage, as any miss meets immediate punishment either in the brutal bunkers or with a challenging putt across the diabolical green, which slopes severely from back to front and left to right.
Hole No. 17 – 590 yards – par 5 After the 16th, the 17th, a long par 5, starts the trek back to the clubhouse. Bunkers wait for misses off the tee both left and right, and the hole climbs uphill, making it tough to reach in two for all except the PGA Tour’s longest hitters. The most memorable feature of the 17th is the varied array of bunkers, which influence decision-making on lay-ups as well as approach shots into the small, well-protected green.
Hole No. 18 – 475 yards – par 4 The round comes to its close at the iconic 18th, which starts with a semi-blind tee shot to a fairway the climbs the side of the canyon. Mature trees loom on the right and force play to the left side of the fairway, lengthening the hole and leading to sidehill lies on the approach. The second shot is a real challenge. A miss left results in a fast pitch from a downhill lie, and a miss right can bound into terrible places. The green sits in a natural amphitheater: a grand setting and a fitting finish to a true championship course.
Riviera does not have memorable views or a memorable property. The reason it’s an unforgettable course is that George Thomas and William Bell made it so. The subtle, strategic design and the outstanding variety of holes test every club in the bag and every facet of the game. Where Riviera especially excels is in taking the full measure of a player’s decision-making skills and nerves—even if that player is one of the best in the world. Year in and year out, Riviera is arguably the best, most entertaining stop on the PGA Tour. While I can’t help wondering how great a faithful restoration of Thomas and Bell’s rugged aesthetics would be, Riviera is still—and will likely always be—one of America’s best championship courses."
28,Riviera,top100,"Pacific Palisades, CA",George Thomas Jr./Billy Bell Sr.,1927,RIVIERA COUNTRY CLUB - 18 POINTS,David Jones,rev028_riviera_2,"Riviera Country Club (or ‘Riv’ as those in the know would have it) is one of American’s most famous golf courses. It’s one of the few places with an enduring event on the PGA Tour. The LA Open was first held here in 1929 and over 75 iterations of the event have been held there since. On top of that, the US Open and the USPGA have both visited and 2028 will bring the Olympics, ensuring Riviera stays firmly in the golf spotlight.

When George Thomas finished the course he declared it his greatest achievement (although it should be noted that this was a common refrain from him!). Once again (cf. Bel Air) imagination was the key to his success. In his definitive account of George Thomas, ‘The Captain’, Geoff Shackelford says, ‘There is little question that Riviera is one of the greatest golf course constructions of all time’. 

This is because the site itself is basically a flat, featureless, canyon valley. There’s not a huge amount of elevation change at Riviera other than the first tee shot and climb up to the 18th.There is a wash running through the middle and that’s about it for natural features. Everything else we see on the course was shaped by Thomas and his team. These days that wouldn’t be such an amazing feat. Modern courses are scooped out of flat sites regularly, as technology has developed. However, in 1927 this was quite an achievement, and the reason the record high $250,000 cost was about three times of that of a normal build of the time.

Most readers will be very familiar with Riviera from the annual TV coverage and it has some of the most iconic holes in the world of professional golf. Here are some of the highlights from my visit to Riviera, as well as some tips for how to get a round. Unlike at most of America’s private courses, the route to playing here is relatively easy (if expensive).

Enjoy the First Tee Experience
Riviera is one of the few courses where everyone gets an announcement on the first tee. When I was there it was a slightly overcast day, and there had been a bit of drizzle in the morning. As a result the place was empty - the only other person around was member, and fellow West Ham supporter, Francesco Molinari working on his putting nearby. What would have counted as a fairly nice day in the east of Scotland had scared all the members away. That didn’t stop the starter clearing his throat and announcing, ‘On the tee, from Scotland, David Jones’. 

I really enjoyed the first hole. You are hitting from a terrace just in front of the clubhouse, down a big drop, onto a huge field below. The fairway isn’t massive side to side but the rough isn’t too punishing. It’s about 280 yards to the dry wash (know as a barranca in these parts) which splits the fairway but I wasn’t expecting to hit a good one, so I hit a driver into the fairway and off we went.

The first at Riviera - probably the easiest hole on the course!

A straightforward par 5 to start is a Thomas trademark and this may be his finest example. Avoiding a topper was the only real thought in my head as we hit off. After that this hole allows you to breathe and enjoy the experience - a lovely start to what would be a memorable round.

A driver from the tee won’t hurt, but it’s all about the angles
I suspect the vast majority of amateur golfers are like me; show us a tee shot with thick trees, water or waist-high rough to the sides of a narrow fairway and we tense up - the swing gets fast and the result is frequently depressing. Well there are no such worries here. From the tee you won’t see huge danger in play. You will almost always be able to hit the ball from wherever it ends up. 

Generally on the course, the rough is of a reasonable depth, most trees allow a punch out and even in the barranca you are likely to have a shot. However, from any of those spots, you will find it hard to get it onto the green with your approach. 

This means that everyone can make progress to the green without too much delay, but only those playing well will have many birdie putts and score well. 

Hitting from hazards is far easier at Riviera than in some LA clubs

Enjoy the special moments….
It is often said that there are no weak holes at Riviera. But there are some standout holes. Some are less well-known than others - I wasn’t familiar with the fifth but it’s sneaky good, with a huge mound built on the right of the fairway blocking your view of the green if you come in from this side. So, you should play up the left to get there in two, but you risk tangling with the trees if you go too far to that side.

The 5th is a less well known, but excellent, hole

Next up is the 6th - a hole to savour. From the middle tees it was just a 7 iron in to this green, but there is a lot to deal with. There are bunkers short, left and behind the green, as well as one bang in the middle! The green slopes significantly from back to front so playing long, past the bunker in the middle, will still leave a challenge for your par. 

The 6th hole at Riviera - note the bunker in the middle of the green

I managed to leave the bunker directly between me and the hole. The scorecard lets you know that amateurs must only take a putter on the green, but I just managed to skirt the edge to hole the putt for a nerve-wracking four. You can see the putt here:

The next hole you are likely to know is the 10th. This is maybe the most famous short par 4 in the world of golf. For years there was a usual choice for pros playing this hole - take a driver and try to get close to the green but risk an offline shot leaving real difficulty getting up and down, or lay back for a fuller shot in. The accuracy and distance of modern equipment mean that virtually all now try to get the ball up to the left of the green, and most succeed.

Looking down the 10th hole from the clubhouse


The challenge for the amateur though is closer to the original intent of the hole. My caddie was very clear, hit a three wood down the left and wedge it in. When you get down there you see what the challenge is. The front of the green is heavily cambered and is just a slither. If the pin is at the front and you are coming in from the right there is virtually no shot a man of my limited skills could hit to keep it on the green. However, from where I was, it was a relatively straightforward wedge up.

The 10th may not pose the same challenge it did to the pros twenty years ago but it is still one of the great examples of a strategic golf hole. Oh yes, and I made a par!

The next few holes have a different feel as you play through the eucalyptus trees. I enjoyed this part of the course which had a lovely serenity about it. 

The 16th hole is a special hole. This short par 3 has a small green, surrounded on all sides by steep, deep bunkers. The sliver trees around the hole add to its beauty and it is just a gorgeous golf hole. All the par threes are pretty special but this may be the best of the lot.

The 16th green is a thing of beauty

The 18th is the final iconic moment in your round. It’s also one of the tougher holes. The tee shot has one of the few forced carries on the course and while it isn’t a long one, it is uphill to a blind fairway - not always a recipe for success. My drive ran off to the right and I was forced to layup in two. In reality though, I would be out there a long time before I hit the green in two. The natural amphitheatre surrounding the green is a fitting climax to your round. As you hole out and look back over the course, you know you’ve just played something pretty special.

If you get a good caddie - enjoy!
I have a checkered past with caddies. It’s not something that I was used to until relatively recently and I’ve only experienced them when playing US private courses. Quite frankly, some of them are useless, just giving me an instruction (‘give me your 160 shot’) followed by a deep sigh when I inevitably screw up. They only take away from my enjoyment of a golf course and usually I would much rather just play on my own. But sometimes it goes well.

My caddie at Riviera was very focussed on me enjoying my round. Before we reached the first green he was already telling me all the celebrities he had caddied for, many in just the last couple of weeks, and the list was impressive. Larry David, President Obama, Justin Timberlake, Tom Brady, Mark Wahlberg - he’d carried for them all. Somehow he managed to impart this information without coming across as an incredible name-dropper (I know, hard to believe!) and it added to my experience of playing Riviera. 

He also had a good knowledge of the club’s history, talked about how the course had changed over the years and tolerated my standard of play with good humour. He didn’t try and play every shot for me, but gave me some advice about the unusual Kikuyu grass and actually explained why he was recommending certain lines or clubs. He added positively to the experience which was a lovely surprise!

Imagine the what if…
There is so much to enjoy at Riviera. It absolutely feels like a golf course well up the top 50 in the world, but there is also a gnawing sense that it could be so much better. I had played Bel Air and LACC on the two days before Riviera. Both have been restored in impressive fashion. LACC is an absolute joy and it feels like you are stepping into a painting from the 1920s. Riviera? Hmm, a bit less so. 

The course has been worked on over the years, but not much has been particularly lauded. A lot of the work in recent years has been done by Fazio and the scars show. Bunkers have lost their original shape, holes have lost their character. The course has been homogenised in too many places when compared to the original Thomas course. When you look at what has been done at LACC you truly wonder what would happen if the club had a management hell-bent on an authentic restoration - it could be magnificent.  

Andy Johnson wrote recently of America’s top candidates for restoration and puts it well when he says, ‘The club could simply restore the original barrancas, bunker styles, and green dimensions without monkeying around with hole lengths or fairway widths. Riviera is currently one of the best golf courses on the West Coast, but it could be one of the best in the country’. The only thing I would add is they could take out the cart paths too…

It would be churlish to end on that note though. Riviera may have flaws in its presentation, but there are none in its design. You don’t have to be an architecture buff to appreciate this course, just teeing it up will be enough. You will find a course which challenges all the way around and you will need every shot in the bag to score well. But it also allows you to breathe, there’s nothing oppressive about Riviera. This is a golf course which will thrill you and give you memories to cherish for life. I’ll tell you one thing, you’ll never forget what you scored at the tenth!

BOOKING THE COURSE

This is yet another one of those American private courses which are hard to play. But the good news is that it isn’t impossible to get a game at Riviera. But be warned - it’s going to cost you.

If you contact the club and explain that you would like to play (I would suggest being suitably reverential in your approach) they may well extend you an offer to play at a quiet time for $575 (late mornings Tuesday-Thursday are best). You obviously need to take a caddie too ($130). Oh yes, and you will need to have an assistant pro accompany you ($200 per group). If you are on your own then that’s a mere $905 for the tee time - it squeezes in under $800 each if you are a 3. Now clearly, on one level this is a ridiculous amount of money to pay for a round of golf. But it you really, really want to do it, and you can afford it, you can play here. That’s more than can be said for LACC or Shinnecock, NGLA or Chicago. 

Of course there are other ways too. Keep an eye out for the charity auctions that come up from time to time (although don’t expect to pay less than the prices above) and a fair few clubs have reciprocals with Riviera. These days Riviera is more and more a club for companies and celebrities, so if you happen to know any of those the route in will be much cheaper.

Prices correct as of August 2023.

29,Friar's Head,top100,"Baiting Hollow, NY",Bill Coore/Ben Crenshaw,2003,FRIAR'S HEAD - 19 POINTS,David Jones,rev029_friar_1,"Friar's Head is a relatively new course on Long Island, not far from the bastions of American golf that are Shinnecock Hills and National Golf Links of America. It is the second highest ranked course built in the last 50 years on the GOLF magazine rating, behind only Sand Hills. It was the first Coore and Crenshaw course that I played and has given me a yearning to play more of their designs. 

This course is simply wonderful, this is one of the very best experiences you will ever have on a golf course and surely it will only continue to rise in the rankings. I have been lucky enough to play at Friar's Head twice now and I enjoyed it even more the second time. 

It's not the easiest place to find - the entrance just marked with a black mail box - and it's closed from early November through to the spring. Even when it is open only gets an average of 10 tee times a day. That's pretty quiet. The first time we played it the condition was perfect, the second time after a tough summer a couple of greens were suffering. It is testament to how great the course is that that didn't diminish our enjoyment at all.

Some of the reviews I had read beforehand made me think that the atmosphere may be a little oppressive. I read about strict rules about no photos (apparently relaxed as no-one mentioned it to us) and the importance of hitting your practice shots in such a way as to minimise the divots on the range. This was mentioned in the nicest possible way and it made perfect sense.

The range facility itself was phenomenal - playing brand new prov1s to proper greens before moving to a short game area and a putting green is to die for. The speed of the practice green was spot on with the rest of the course and served as a great way to get your eye in.

Before venturing out onto the course you can play a delightful little nine-holer. No hole was longer than 160 yards but it's a nice way to warm up before taking on the main event. It demanded creativity and certainly sharpened the wedge play nicely.
Friar's Head Coore Crenshaw Golf Course Review
So, to the course itself. There are some articles out there about Friar's Head which do it far better justice than I ever can. This one from Ran Morrissett over at Golf Club Atlas is probably the best and will give you a hole by hole account of the course. There was some discussion on that site as to Friar's Head should be a Doak 9 or 10 when the latest Confidential Guide came out. In the end he gave it a 9, personally I think he was being a bit stingy! 

The course starts with a very playable par 4. I hit driver, but less would do to a wide fairway (actually, I found the sand on the right) and then it's a wedge on 9 iron up to the elevated green (it reminded me of the 1st at the Kings at Gleneagles for those familiar with the opener there).
Friar's Head Scorecard

It is a tremendously hard course to characterise. Holes are carved out of the dunes and the trees and the course transitions seemingly effortlessly between the two. Much is made if you look online at the fact that there are no yardages on the scorecard or tees and there are no yardages to greens on the course. There is a yardage book now available in the pro shop now, but our caddies were fantastic and gave us everything we needed. They gave yardages on the tee, the course measured an almost perfect 6,460 yards. Anything over 6,500 yards and I find that the par 3s can be a little long and the approaches to the par 4s a little testing. This was just right!

There is not a weak hole on the golf course. The 3rd was playing a little shorter to us due to the wind on both occasions but is a 420 yard sweeping uphill hole, often playing the longest par 4 in the course. In contrast the 5th is a delightful short par 4 of only 300 yards. The first time I played I took a driver and then, thinking I was in North Berwick still, took a putter from 50 yards out just to get the wrong slide of a slope and take another 4 to get down. I was in almost the same spot 12 months later and shanked a wedge this time. Ah, the joys! Number 9 plays back through the dunes from the clubhouse to the most fiendish green.  This is pure quality all the way.  

The 10th is a quirky 200 yard par 3 with a truly huge, mostly blind, green. It not be the longest par 3 you'll every play but if your tee shot goes anywhere apart from the right quadrant of the green you are looking at bogey or worse.
The 14th at Friar's Head

14 is a simply magnificent par 5 with steps behind leading up to spectacular 15th tee. Looking back, I should have taken a rescue club off the tee the first time but the caddie did well to find it for me in the wasteland to the right. I managed a par second time around and had some vengeance. The walk from 15 to 16, along the side of the ocean is pretty special and the closing holes continue in the vein of the rest of the course. Breathtaking, fair, and an experience not to be forgotten.

As you can see, I loved this place. The set-up was understated, friendly but incredibly high quality; the caddies were great and the course a dream. Our caddie was telling us that he had caddied earlier in the week for Coore and Crenshaw who are regular visitors - looking at how they can continue to tweak the course. That attention really pays off.

It's definitely the kind of course you just want to go straight back out and play again. It's the best modern course I have played and I would rate it right up there in my top half dozen yet. If you ever get the chance, drop everything and go

BOOKING THE COURSE

Being an American private course a tee time here is tricky. There used to be an annual charity day here but that has moved. Your best bet now is checking out Charitybuzz which regularly has auctions for three balls where you will then join a member to make up a fourball. It’s not a cheap way of playing the course, but unless you know a member it may be the only way!"
30,Friar's Head,top100,"Baiting Hollow, NY",Bill Coore/Ben Crenshaw,2003,Friar’s Head Golf Club: One of the Best Golf Days of My Life,Sean Ogle,rev030_friar_2,"023 was a good golf year, to put it mildly.

For years, I’d done a pretty good job of playing at a bunch of new courses each year as I grew Breaking Eighty and my golf travel IQ.


Then COVID hit.

I didn’t get on an airplane for 21 months.

During that time I also had my first kid, which as you might guess, doesn’t lend itself well to travel.

Well, in 2023 I made up for lost time.

It started with 4 days at Bandon Dunes in January.

In February, I spent the month in Australia with my family playing courses that I legitimately never thought I’d get to play like Barnbougle Dunes and New South Wales. Not to mention half a dozen more I have yet to write about here on Breaking Eighty.

In May it was Paynes Valley.

June, Oakmont followed by Kohanaiki.

August brought rounds at Hualalai, Merion, Aronimink, Baltusol, Quaker Ridge, and Wykagyl.

But it was my first round in September that was the one I’d been waiting a decade to play:

Friar’s Head.

I’ve listed Bandon Trails among my top 10 favorite courses for years.

Coore and Crenshaw have worked on some really special projects.

But the mystique around Friar’s Head has always intrigued me. 

Insane views on Long Island?

Extremely exclusive, small membership – with an initiation fee most of us couldn’t ever fathom?

And that’s all completely ignoring the fact that it’s routinely listed among the top 25 courses in the World.

It’s the ultimate golf day, and one that, unfortunately, most golfers will never get to play.

Somehow I won the lottery and last Summer got to spend a day at Friar’s Head.

I’ve played a lot of really special golf courses and had some unbelievable golf days.

My day at Friar’s Head was one of the top 3 golf days of my life.

Let me tell you about it.

Getting to Friar’s Head

I’ve traveled a fair amount within the Pacific Northwest with my friend Jeff, but we’d never taken a golf trip.

So after years of talking about it, I finally convinced him to come to New York with me.

We went all out, playing all of the aforementioned courses across Philly and the NYC area.

But the night before Friar’s Head, which was our last round of the trip, was the only night we stayed in Manhattan.

I splurged and got us a room at the Park Hyatt, and told him I was taking him on the cocktail tour of his life. It started at the #2 bar in the world, Double Chicken Please. It ended at the Dead Rabbit, the former #1 bar in the world, and there 7 world-class bars in between.

Our tee time wasn’t until 1, we’d be fine, right?

The hangover was bad, but it was the traffic jam getting out of Manhattan that caused the biggest headache.

1 hour to go 4 blocks.

If we missed this tee time, I’d never forgive myself.

Fortunately, once we got out of the city the Long Island Expressway traffic was fairly light and we pulled onto 3000 Sound Avenue about 30 minutes before our tee time.

Friars Head Mailbox
The iconic 3000 mailbox.
We were escorted to the wonderful range and practice area, where we hit a few quick balls (Pro V1s, of course) before heading back towards the first tee where we met the members who were hosting us.

They were friends of a friend who (very) generously agreed to have us out. It took all of about half a hole to realize just how welcoming they were – and honestly, this is really what made the day so special.

The Front 9 at Friar’s Head

Despite being so excited to play this course, I didn’t know that much about it.


I purposefully refrained from doing much research ahead of time.

I’d also heard stories about how strict they were about taking photos on the course. Not wanting to make an awkward ask of the people hosting us, I left my camera in the car.

Big mistake, considering it was a chamber of commerce day and they said the photo policy has been loosened quite a bit over the years.

So here, you get iPhone photos 🙂

The opening tee shot isn’t overly challenging with a big wide fairway. But then the approach is to a severely elevated, deep green. It doesn’t take long to figure out you should trust your caddie with, well, everything.

Friars Head Hole 1
The elevated green on the first gole
The opening on the Kings Course at Gleneagles is the most similar opening hole I’ve seen. The approach also has vibes of the approach on the first hole at Bandon Dunes.

There are a lot of impressive viewpoints around the course. Simply looking back at the clubhouse from the first green is one of them.

The second tee shot is the next. An elevated tee shot that plays downhill and gives a great view of the front 9.

Friars Head Hole 2
The tee shot on 2.
The two 9s each roughly form circles is a bit of aa figure 8 routing. The back 9 plays counterclockwise on one part of the property, and then when you hit 10 it plays (mostly) clockwise around a separate part of the property – with a finishing stretch near the Long Island Sound.


The 5th is one of the great short par 4s in golf, measuring around 300 yards. There are no yardages on the scorecard, so you end up playing holes from a variety of fun distances.

It’s also welcome after the monster par 3, 4th.

Friars Head 4th hole
Par 3, 4th hole
That said, short doesn’t mean “easy”. As if you don’t strike your drive well you could easily find yourself in a gnarly bunker to the right of the green.

And if you do strike it well, there’s another bunker right in the middle of your ideal line that could also swallow your ball.

It wouldn’t be a Coore Crenshaw course without a short par 4.

Just watch out for this bunker on your drive.
The par 5, 7th is a standout hole. A wonderful uphill par 5 that brings you back into the dunes and is one of the more visually stunning holes on the front.

Friars Head Hole 7
The uphill par 5, 7th. Wish I’d gotten a photo of this green.
The greens on the course are among the best I’ve ever played in terms of variety and interest. The 7th is particularly interesting given how massive it is and with fairly severe contours and mounding.

The downhill 9th is arguably the signature hole (or at least the signature photo spot.)

Friars Head Hole 9
The view from 9 tee.
For years, the only photo I saw of the course was from 9 teebox looking back down at the clubhouse and over the sound.

It’s truly one of the best views in golf.

The Back 9 at Friar’s Head

The back 9 starts out with a long, 200-ish yard par 3. The signature here is the large mound that guards the left side of the green and feels more reminiscent of something built in Scotland 100 years ago.

The par 5s at Friar’s Head are cool in that they feel like they’re transporting you into different environments of the course.

2 takes you down into the meadow, then 7 is back up into the dunes.

11 brings you back down again, and then 14 takes you up into the dunes and is the beginning of a world-class finishing stretch of holes.

Looking back at 11
Seriously, the stretch of 14-18 is among the very best stretch of golf holes I’ve ever played.

14 is a risk-reward par 5 that has a little bit of everything. 

Friars Head Hole 14
14 begins one of the very best stretch of holes I’ve ever played.
You can bail out left to stay safe from a massive bunker, but it makes the hole significantly longer.

The more of the bunker you take on, the shorter the hole gets, but your margin for error increases in step with the aggressiveness of your line.

The green is set in a natural amphitheater and has a bit of a false front to it. 

Notice the stairs going up to the 15th teebox. The only better walk, is the one walking off the 15th.

15 is a downhill par 4 that heads straight out towards the Long Island Sound.

The 15th.
It’s another fantastic view. If you’re a better player than me and don’t pump it into the waste area right (exactly where you don’t want to be), it can be a chance to score as the green isn’t quite as intense as some others on the course.

But the most memorable moment of the round is the one that everyone had told me about, the bridge from 15 to 16.

Friars Head Bridge
Looking back at the bridge between 15 and 16. Sitting here was one of the coolest golf moments I’ve had.
I haven’t played Cypress Point, but I imagine the walks to 15 and 16 elicit similar feelings to what you get walking to 16 at Friar’s Head.

16 is a fantastic par 4, that is deceptively difficult. This is one of those holes you need to play a few times to understand it. The obvious play is to go out to the right. But what you don’t realize is that if you’re short, you’re actually leaving yourself with a much longer shot than if you go over the ridge left.

Friars Head 16 Approach
The approach on 16.

It’s hard not to get on the tee at 17 without thinking “how cool would it be to hit a hole-in-one here?”

It’s the last par 3, the shortest hole on the course. But despite appearing “easy” on paper, anything less than an ideally struck shot can end up in the waste bunker where bogey or worse quickly becomes the most likely outcome.

The final par 3.
Finally, 18 is a challenging par 4 that requires two very well-struck shots in order to give yourself a fighting chance. I had one of my better drives of the day, and then hitting the green in front of the clubhouse and making an easy two-putt par was a great way to finish.

The approach on 18.
The Showers at Friar’s Head

No proper article about Friar’s Head would be complete without mentioning the showers.

The showers here are the only thing more legendary than the course itself.

For years I’ve always heard about Merion being the gold standard of golf showers – and to be clear, they’re very good.

But the showers at Friar’s Head? They blow them away. Literally.

This is the closest thing you’ll experience to getting blasted from a firehouse short of walking out of a burning building.

I’ve never experienced anything like it. If you visit, do whatever you can to experience this as it is truly the best shower in golf.

Final Thoughts on Friar’s Head

Awhile back I wrote about bucket list courses that actually exceed expectations.

Friar’s Head is the perfect example of this.

Yes, we had a spectacular day. Yes, the company was phenomenal. A lot was working in our favor.

But Friar’s Head is one of those courses you could play day in and day out and never get bored. There are so many nuances and interesting elements that you could play dozens of rounds and still find something new each time.

I’d like to think I’ll have the chance to visit Friar’s Head again in the future. But if I don’t? I’m incredibly thankful for the opportunity and for what immediately became one of the best golf days of my life.

The course is amazing. The setting and the experience is even better."
31,Winged Foot (West),top100,"Mamaroneck , NY",A.W. Tillinghast,1923,Approaching the Unpinnable,Andy Johnson,rev031_winged_foot_1,"“I wish we played a course like this every week. We’d learn how to putt.” -Jack Nicklaus at the 1974 U.S. Open People often describe the greens at the West Course at Winged Foot Golf Club as treacherous, or scary, or beautiful. I would call them enduring. Designed by A.W. Tillinghast in 1923, the greens at Winged Foot West are the definition of severe. Getting up and down from around them is very difficult, which puts a premium on precise approach shots. Also, the greens have an abundance of unpinnable surface: the false fronts, back wings, and sideboards make short-sided misses a nightmare and reward creative pitches and chips. These features make Winged Foot a great course in spite of its geographical shortcomings (rocky slate soil and relatively bland topography) and have helped it endure the onslaught of advances in equipment technology. Nearly 100 years into its life, Winged Foot West is still one of the world’s great championship tests.

The U.S. Open last visited Winged Foot in 2006, when Geoff Ogilvy won at 5-over. Since then, the players have picked up yet more technological aids. This will be the first time that the world’s best male players will take on the bold, sloping Tillinghast greens with the help of green-reading books that will show them every intricate contour. Winged Foot’s counter will be its restoration, finished by Hanse Golf Course Design in 2015. Gil Hanse enlarged the West Course’s greens by 23.8%, regaining tucked pins not seen since the 1920s and increasing unpinnable surface, which drives the strategy of the course. Winged Foot West’s strategy is best understood from the greens backwards. It’s all about knowing whether or not you are in position to approach certain pins. Of course, for the most part, Winged Foot is a test of execution. The fairways are narrow and lined with thick rough and deep dunkers. But players who walk the course backwards and figure out where they can and can’t attack certain greens will stand the best chance of avoiding those zero-penalty-stroke double bogeys, which the West Course is famous for inflicting. At this week’s U.S. Open, recovery shots will be more about getting back into a position to make par or bogey rather than pulling off a heroic shot for a chance at birdie.

Gil Hanse’s restoration of the greens adds a new dimension. When we last saw the West Course host the U.S. Open in ’06, the greens were shadows of their original selves. They had shrunk, and many of their pronounced corners and fronts had been covered in rough. While often unpinnable, these contours on the edges of the greens produce the theatrics that make Winged Foot truly compelling. The severe grades, often above 10%, punish not only approaches from bad positions but also marginal shots from good positions. Hanse and his team brought back a considerable amount of pinnable surface as well. In the graphic below, provided by Winged Foot Golf Club, you can see that the expansion of the 15th green boosted the average slope by 14% but also increased the amount of pinnable area by 43%.



What does all of this mean? Simply that there are now more options for pins and more contours to bedevil shots from poor angles. Unlike at many PGA Tour stops, where any pin on a grade of more than 1% is frowned upon, there will be many putts at Winged Foot that turn hard at the hole. There will be short-sided pitches that bound forward after landing on the recaptured unpinnable sections. On the flip side, there will also be shots, played from the right positions, that use the same contours to funnel the ball closer to the pin. Basically, these greens will reward players who keep a clear head and pay attention to the ground. There’s an important takeaway for the golf world here. It’s time to embrace undulating greens rather than calling them “unfair” or “Mickey Mouse,” or making the same tired joke about how “all that’s missing is a windmill.” Winged Foot West’s greens are what made the course interesting and challenging in the 1920s, and what will continue to make it interesting and challenging in the 2020s. Yes, they’re playing a lot faster now—probably faster than they should—but their essence has endured. At many modern courses, on the other hand, the greens already seem dated, partly because they don’t have the courage to be wild."
32,Winged Foot (West),top100,"Mamaroneck , NY",A.W. Tillinghast,1923,WINGED FOOT (WEST) - 18 POINTS,David Jones,rev032_winged_foot_2,"I went to Winged Foot by accident. We were due to play a highly ranked course of good repute in Long Island (OK, it was Shinnecock), but they had decided to dump several tons of sand on every green and it was unplayable. So, on that late October morning we found ourselves making a dash to Winged Foot, 30 minutes north of Manhattan and a dream of a course.

Frankly, I was a little worried. The trip was for my Dad’s 70th birthday and I thought it would be too tough for both of us. When I was a kid in the 80s, I remember my Dad having a book about the story of the 1974 US Open that recounted all the horrors that unfolded. I imagined it would be a long slog, with little joy. I’m glad to say I couldn't have been more wrong. 

The first decision we made was a good one - to play off the white tees which were around the magic 6,500 yard mark. It took a little of the sting out of the course and meant that only a couple of holes were totally out of reach in regulation.

For some reason, I had in my mind a course crafted out of a forest, where any shot off line would be hard to find and have no shot back into play. Wrong again. The rough was clingy and thick, but it was still possible to advance it reasonably if you weren’t too greedy. Often recoveries would get just short of the green leaving a good chance of knocking it on. However when we arrived at the green we were faced with some of the most devilish set-ups in the world.

The green complexes are one of the defining characteristics of Winged Foot. Most of them tilt from back to front, so where you leave your approach shot is absolutely key. The first green gives you a wonderful taste of what is to come. It’s a vast, tilting, sloping, bewildering expanse. It is impossible to play it without a sense of wonder and joy!
The 1st green at Winged Foot - a thing of wonder!

Your eyes can deceive you at Winged Foot. There are false fronts galore and the nuances of the slopes mean that playing away from the pin and letting the ball roll in will often be the smart play. It may sound odd, but I found some similarities to a Scottish links course. You can putt the ball from way out, and it may be easier to get the ball to the hole that way rather than trying to get there with a wedge.

The par 5s were all accessible; I was up on 2 of the 4 and I'm not a long hitter. Conversely the 3s are long, with 3 of the 4 being over 190 yards. The standout would be the 10th. With the pin at the back we were playing 195 yards over a valley, but a well hit tee shot was all it took to have a massively sloping 60 footer for birdie (not made!).

Founded in 1906, Winged Foot is a wonderfully historic place to play golf. There are so many great anecdotes, but the 2006 US Open added another bucketful to keep the magic alive. For us Brits, Monty's 7 iron short of the green, pitch and three putt for double lives long in the memory. For what it's worth, I did one better from the same spot on the fairway. It’s another hole defined by the green - a false front will push the ball down to a dell, there are intricate humps and hollows, and you need to be the right side of the flag to have a chance of getting down in 2.

You shouldn’t expect to shoot the lights out at Winged Foot - it’s one of the most revered US Open sites. But you shouldn’t approach it with fear like I did! Suffice to say, off the right tees (I cannot emphasise that point enough) I think that any golfer would have a great time at Winged Foot. I found it a really exhilarating place to play golf. At times your pulse will be racing, but there is also a real calm feeling out in the whispering trees.

I was lucky enough to get back to Winged Foot in September 2019, after the mercurial Gil Hanse had completed a fantastic renovation of the West Course. Bunkers have come out, greens reclaimed and the course is even better for it. As a result of the green expansion work (back to the original sizes) there will be new pin positions possible when the 2020 US Open visits. When I was there they were already well along with getting things ready for the event. The fairways had definitely come in a bit and the rough was a little deeper but I still didn’t feel that it was an unfair challenge. But boy, when they get those greens going for the pros it will be quite scary in places.

This may be the best parkland course I have played. If you get the chance to play it then definitely take up the offer(!), you won't be disappointed. It's a very strong 18 points!

BOOKING THE COURSE

Well, this is a hard one. It is a high end course which isn't particularly accessible. However, if you are really set on it, then my advice would be to look out for the charity auctions as New Yorkers are a benevolent lot and there are a few opportunities to play there every year. 

TOUR TIPS

If you are playing other courses in the area (Quaker Ridge may be the pick of the lot) then there are tips for staying locally on the Westchester page. Failing that, you are only 30 minutes from Manhattan so you can enjoy the attractions of the Big Apple before heading up. 

Play here is usually only with a member but, if your host has the time I would thoroughly encourage you to try to play the East course too. It is a more accessible course for sure, but fits into the property wonderfully. There are some I know who even prefer it to the West. If you start early enough there should be no problem getting round both the East and the West.

You can’t book a tee time on either course usually - it’s a first-come-first-served roll up on the 1st tee. Caddies are mandatory, and pretty essential when it comes to reading these greens.

This really feels like an old-school members’ club. The locker rooms are reminiscent of those in a 1950s boarding school, there are idiosyncrasies like the burnt toast served before lunch and the ginger biscuits with peanut butter after 9 holes. The clubhouse is adorned with memorabilia from days gone by and you won’t have to wait long to hear stories from the past.

I would also do a shout out to the pro shop. I think it may be the best stocked anywhere in the world. The range is huge and really well sourced. That, combined with the very cool Winged Foot logo, means you will find it hard to leave without getting the credit card out."
33,Pacific Dunes,top100,"Bandon, OR",Tom Doak,2001,Review: Pacific Dunes,Andrew Harvie,rev033_pacific_dunes_1,"“One is a curiosity, two is a destination.” Mike Keiser’s now-famous words represent the expansion of Bandon Dunes Golf Resort, where the destination began with David McLay Kidd’s Bandon Dunes, and became a golf resort with Pacific Dunes.

To this day, Pacific Dunes is considered one of, if not Tom Doak’s best and is consistently debated as the #1 public golf course in North America, alongside Pebble Beach and Pinehurst No. 2.


Opening the golf course, a 370 yard short par 4 greets golfers. Although I have heard some criticism of this hole, like it awkward or not an exciting way to start, I have no issues.


While not the most breathtaking hole here, I love the green complex, which sits into the landscape quite nicely.


The 2nd begins the journey to the Pacific Ocean with a 368 yard two-shot hole. One centreline bunker and one bunker left make it obvious where the preferred angle is, but makes for a more difficult tee shot.


From the right, the golfer plays over the short right bunker with a backstop, which helps. It does not funnel balls as much as it appears to, but will help stop balls from bouncing long. The movement in this green is quite severe; I am a fan.


A better, closer look at the green complex.


The third is the first par 5 at Pacific Dunes, playing one yard shy of 500 due west. A mess of bunkers in the middle provide a distinct left or right angle, with the left side being preferred for those trying to get home in two.


This is a lovely green complex, with some textbook strategy. Tucked into the dune, bunkering on the right corner angles the green from 8-2 on a clock, with a bunker on the left for those who layup. As mentioned, playing left of the bunkers is key to get home in two for longer hitters.


This is just a pleasant green location, which will reveal the Pacific Ocean upon arrival. Less movement than the first two (although still impressive), but a smarter green complex—in my view—as it sits up higher, exposed to the wind, whereas the first two sat down low almost on-grade or below-grade.


The 4th is our introduction to why Pacific Dunes is so highly regarded. Sure, the Pacific Ocean flanks the hole on the right, but behind us is now the 13th, which we play later. Getting a routing to have both nines to play on the major feature of the golf course in a way without long walks puts this golf course up against almost anything else. At 463 yards, this is a monster with the ocean—as mentioned—up the right, and two big bunkers on the left. The more right you can play, the better.


This green is so brilliant. Sitting low into the landscape, the big bunker on the right is blown out, with slopes and contours coming off the left side and bleeding into the green. Why is this important? Bailing out left brings a much more difficult approach to a green that almost slopes away from the golfer now. From the right, you can use the slopes to feed the ball in. A master class in angles, all controlled by the green contours.


After a brief introduction with the ocean, we head inland with the 199 yard par 3, 5th. This is a cool par 3, with a very long green with undulations akin to the ocean waves you just saw on the previous hole.


As mentioned, Pacific’s strength is its routing, bringing you to the Pacific Ocean on three different occurances. However, the separator when debating it against its contemporaries is the strength of the inland holes, which might be better than the oceanside stuff. That begins on the 316 yard par 4, 6th, among the best drive-and-pitch holes on planet earth.


Given the distance of the hole, it should be drivable, but I would love to hear stories of someone keeping it on this green. Set high above the fairway and the two massive bunkers on the left, the hole almost has a verse S shape to it. Hitting it straight to your preferred number will leave a difficult, semi-blind wedge up over the bunkers.


Playing out to the right is better, but you will not get a full wedge.


Cranking driver up near the green could work, but leaves a difficult pitch.


I have played Pacific Dunes twice, one day with 70KM/H winds, and one with no wind, and this is an insanely challenging hole in the wind. Even with no wind, there is trouble everywhere.


The 7th is a very good long par 4 at 464 yards playing back into the forest. The fairway is undulating, but no bunkers or anything, so a nice time to let loose a bit. Missing the fairway too far left or right will result in a lost ball.


This is such a great green complex. I think the picture below speaks for itself.


Another look at the green complex from 2018. This is one of the few approach shots here where I felt like I had to hit it in the air, but a nice change of pace for variety’s sake.

The actual green contours are superb, as well. I was infatuated with this hole on my second spin.


A fairly standard par 4 tee shot at the 8th awaits. At 400 yards on the nose, it is a middle length par 4.


This is another great green complex, with a reverse strategy. Instead of challenging the bunker like that at the 2nd or 3rd, playing to the outside corner actually opens up the green more. The location of the putting surface is A1.


The 9th is a peculiar par 4, but one that I like. 406 yards, we play over a ridge to a blind fairway with two fairways into one.


With a lower green and an upper green, the 9th can be played in two different ways, depending on where the turf department cuts the pin that day. Getting it on the right side of the fairway is preferred, especially to the upper green (which I believe is the more popular of the two).

Left green:


Right green:


The upper green has some impressive movement. I have never played the lower green.


The dual green sets up the start of the back nine with a lower and upper tee, although the upper tee seems to have a better view. At 206 yards, it is a longer par 3 playing back towards the Pacific Ocean with quote the backdrop.


One of the more odd choices of Pacific Dunes, but another thing to seperate itself, is the back-to-back par 3’s to start the back nine, continuing with the 148 yard par 3, 11th. A very demanding short par 3, with a narrow green pinched between bunkering, the ocean, and the hillside.


The tee shot is breathtaking here, and one of the best spots in golf. But the hole isn’t over; the green is amazing as well.

After a superb stretch of golf, it had to come down eventually. Granted, I think having interludes is an important feature of Kendrick Lamar’s To Pimp a Butterfly, so having a small interlude here does not hurt. At 529 yards, a par 4 plays around the 4th with a couple bunkers in play.


The layup is fairly chill.


The green complex is another winner, with a massive bunker short left sloping towards the green, fighting the contours coming off the dune that sits to the right. In my view, the green complex really makes the 12th. A perfect reprieve.


A better look, sitting beautifully in between its surroundings.


Why the need for the reprieve? We head to the 444 yard par 4, 13th, a beautifully difficult par 4 alongside the Pacific, with the ocean up the left now.


The green complex sits into the hillside, playing more uphill than you think. At this point, I had hit the first 12 greens in a row, so the caddie for the other people in my group started giving advice because he said he’d never seen anyone hit all 18 greens. He has now, and I am sure it has been done before, but it was one of the better rounds of 2021 for me.


The 14th is the shortest par 3 at Pacific Dunes, maxing out at 145 yards. The caddies in the group joked that Tom Doak never built an island green like his mentor Pete Dye, but the 14th is as close as he got. The green has little margin for error, wrapped with trouble. Additionally, the 14th sits exposed to the wind, high above the 13th and in the dune.


The 15th is a fairly flat and spacious par 5, measuring 539 yards.


An easy way to dunk on Pacific Dunes is targeting the back nine par 5’s with the 12th and 15th because they are less dramatic and more “plain” in presentation, but I disagree. For one, they both head in opposite directions, and given their short nature, one will generally allow the golfer to get after it and push for a birdie. Secondly, the green complexes are still superb, but before the 15th green, we still have to lay up.


What a sick green complex, with a hump short right and the green pushed up. Going for it in two is a viable option on days with the wind coming from the north, but it can be quite difficult to hit.


At 338 yards, I am still not quite sure what to think of the 16th, which continues to play much shorter than the yardage with a summer wind.


You can cut the corner, but it leaves a difficult approach to a green with some intriguing movement. The fairway is as if you crumpled up a piece of paper and tried to smooth is out again. There is no flat lies to be found here, complicating things further.


A different view of the terrain awaiting, which can either be found by cutting the corner on the tee shot of this dogleg right, or the approach shot trying to stop the ball on this somehow-firmer-than the rest.

IMG_2086.JPG
The 17th is a beautiful 208 yard par 3, notably utilizing the redan template. Play it out right and see it funnel down, but it will not get all the way back to the left, likely stopping in the right third.


Finishing off, Pacific Dunes ends on the longest hole on the golf course at 591 yards. A massive blowout bunker that sits on the inside corner of the dogleg left must be avoided at all costs.


The layup is all about not getting ahead of yourself and finishing strong. Fairly straightforward, at this point it is a test of stamina.


A beautiful green site to end the day, well bunkered with a quasi-punchbowl feel.


Run, do not walk, to Pacific Dunes, but I suspect most reading this review already knew that. This is an easy #1 at the resort for me, and among the best golf courses I have ever seen."
34,Pacific Dunes,top100,"Bandon, OR",Tom Doak,2001,Is Pacific Dunes the Best Public Course in America? It Might Well Be.,Sean Ogle,rev034_pacific_dunes_2,"I’ve spent pretty much my entire life living in Oregon. Yet for some reason, I didn’t make it down to Bandon until last November – or 14 years after Bandon Dunes first opened it’s doors.

Every year my golf buddies and I would say, this is the year we’re going to do it, and every year, time, money, or other commitments got in the way.

So when I was out at Portland Golf Club in October, and their membership director told me they needed one more guy for a November trip down to Bandon there really was no way I could turn it down.


And thus began my first trip to what some are calling Golf Mecca.

While I’ve talked to people lucky enough to go down there for a week or more, our trip was a bit abbreviated. Leave on a Monday, back on a Wednesday.  I’ll tell stories and give details of the trip throughout the 4 posts I write about the 4 courses we played, but it started by meeting in Portland at 6am and hightailing it down I5 for 4 hours until we arrived in the seaside town.

Now if you’ve ever been to Oregon, you know that November can be, how shall we say, a little dicey.

For my first trip, I was just hoping for no rain.

When we pulled through the gates and headed out to the practice range, we weren’t met with sun, but it wasn’t raining and it wasn’t that cold – which was perfect in my mind.

There were 16 of us playing Ryder Cup style: the long standing members of the club, and the new members (or non-members), which included myself.

I’d go into the whole handicap fiasco, but if you’re interested in that, see this post.

We hit our balls and after shaking off the nerves we headed over to Pacific Dunes to grab lunch and hit the first tee.

Somehow I ended up with the club champion, and the guy who holds the course record on Pacific  – Tim Hval, the former head pro at the resort.

All I could think was “God, I hope I don’t embarrass myself…”

The Course

Pacific Dunes was the second course built at Bandon and was completed in 2001 and designed by Tom Doak. I’ve always loved Tom’s designs and his minimalist nature.


Pacific is pretty spectacular in the sense that it seems like the course was always there. By looking at it, you wouldn’t have thought an ounce of dirt was moved – the landscape is that fitting for golf.

It’s got a quirky layout going out with one par 3 and coming in with 4 on the back – but that’s part of what makes Pacific Dunes so unique.

It’s highly rated on just about every list there is, including:

#1 Top Courses You Can Play (Golf Magazine)
#20 Top Courses in the World (Golf Magazine)
#3 Top 100 Public in the Country (Golf Digest)
#19 Top 100 in the Country (Golf Digest)
#21 Top 100 in the World (Golf Digest)
I don’t care who you are or what publication you look at, Pacific Dunes isn’t just good, it’s world class.

It’d be my first round at Bandon, and one that had sky high expectations.

Did my experience live up to them? Well, let’s look at the course and I’ll let you know at the end.

Hole by Hole

Distances are from the  6,142 yard green tees, which is where we played.

Hole 1 (Par 4, 304 Yards)

The opening hole at Pacific Dunes isn’t nearly as scary as it looks.

You step up to the tee and in front of you you’ll see rugged undulations, areas of sand and gorse – but no green.

It’s hidden slightly down the right.  That said, there’s more room out there than you think, so keep it left center of the fairway and consider a hybrid or wood – that should get you close enough for an easy wedge on approach.

Pacific Dunes at Bandon Dunes Golf Resort

Hole 2 (Par 4, 335 yards)

#2 is a really well designed short par 4.


You ideally want to be on the left of the fairway for your approach shot, but you have two big bunkers that you’ll have to avoid if you want to be there. Right side is safe, but will two greenside bunkers into play.

Along with reading Dream Golf before you’re next round at Bandon, I’d recommend reading Tom Doak’s Anatomy of a Golf Course. Really helps to put into perspective, why the courses are laid out the way they are – and it gives you a better sense of why they’re ranked as highly as they are.

Pacific Dunes at Bandon Dunes Resort is the #3 Top 100 Public Course in the US

Hole 3 (Par 5, 476 yards)

The first par 5 is a tough hole, even if it’s length doesn’t seem like it.

You have 3 bunkers that are more or less in the middle of the fairway, so you need to actually make shots, rather than just bombing the ball.  Left fairway is a safe bet, or if you can clear the first bunker, directly over it will line you up for the best angle into the green on your approach.


A great example of why having a caddy or yardage book is so essential at Bandon.

Also, whatever you do: don’t go short-right of the green. Took me 3 shots to get out of that bunker.

A little taste of what could be if you don’t place you’re first shot well.

Hole 4 (Par 4, 449 yards)

This is the moment you’ve been waiting for. The hole where “Pacific Dunes” really becomes the course you were expecting. A par 4 over the cliffs of the Pacific Ocean, you obviously can’t miss right. Ever.

I tried, slicing my drive, but there was a convenient little nook right around 250 yards that kept my ball from dropping in (by inches).

This hole has constantly been rated as one of the best par 4s in the world, and once you’re on the tee, it’s not hard to see why.

Welcome to one of the best par 4s you’ll ever play.

Par 5 (Par 3, 181 yards)

The only par 3 on the front, and probably my least favorite of the 5 (you have a lot to look forward to on the back). Also, one of the more difficult greens on the course.

Hole 6 (Par 4, 288 yards)

A fun short par 4 (seems like we’ve already had a few of those, which I really like). You’ll want to be in the center of the fairway edging towards the right for the best angle at a very narrow green. Too far left and not only do you have to contend with the big bunker left of the green, but it makes the green ridiculously shallow, with a big drop off on the right.

Hole 7 (Par 4, 436 yards)

Some people consider this the most difficult course on the entire property. It’s an extremely long par 4 playing 464 from the tips.  If the wind is in your face good luck reaching the green – give the course some respect and layup. That being said, there are some weird bumps and patches of heavy rough that will make finding your ball extremely difficult.

Careful you don’t layup too close to the green
Hole 8 (Par 4, 369 yards)

Another long Par 4 that often plays into the wind (we got lucky and the wind was pretty minimal). Watch out for the false front and make sure you take enough club into your approach.

Hole 9 (Par 4, 379 yards)

This starts one of my favorite strings of hole on any course I’ve ever played. 9-14 of Pacific Dunes are world class no matter how you put it.

9 is somewhat similar to #3 on Old Macdonald as you have a blind tee shot up to a ridge with plenty of room over it.

This hole is also unique in that it actually has two greens an upper and lower – so pay attention to which one is in play.

Pacific Dunes is a Top 100 Golf Course in Bandon, Oregon

Hole 10 (Par 3, 163 yards)

You start the back 9 off with one of the most specactular par 3s on the paroperty. An elevated tee plays down to a green that sits right on top of the Pacific, giving you unparalled 360 degree views.


Watch out for unplayable lies in the thick brush to the left of the green, slightly right is the safer play.

Hole 11 (Par 3, 131 yards)

Just when you thought it couldn’t get any better, Hole 11 is another par 3 and has the smallest green. Playing parallel with the Ocean, I promise this a hole (and a view) you won’t soon forget.

Pacific Dunes is a Top 100 Golf Course in Bandon, Oregon



Hole 12 (Par 5, 507 yards)

After back to back par 3s we have a reachable par 5. The biggest danger here is going to be your approach, especially if you’re trying to get home in two. There’s a big bunker guarding the front of the green, and a large mound right behind the green that doesn’t give you a whole lot of room to work with – so keep a close eye on your yardages.

Pacific Dunes is a Top 100 Golf Course in Bandon, Oregon



Hole 13 (Par 4, 390 yards)

13 gives #4 a run for it’s money as the best par 4 on the course. Playing the opposite way as #4 (meaning into the wind) two accurate shots are necessary.  This is a deep and narrow green, so consult your caddie as to where the hole location is for the day.

Also don’t forget to take a second on the tee and soak in your surroundings, golf simply doesn’t get a whole lot better than this.

Pacific Dunes is a Top 100 Golf Course in Bandon, Oregon

Hole 14 (Par 3, 128 yards)

While not right on the ocean, 14 is still a really cool par 3. Take note of the wind, as this hole can play much shorter than it’s yardage states.

Pacific Dunes is a Top 100 Golf Course in Bandon, Oregon



Hole 15 (Par 5, 504 yards)

This hole sucked…well for me at least ha. My tee shot barely cleared the gorse on the left and popped over to the next fairway. Because of my struggles aiming I didn’t get a photo of this one, so we’ll just move onto 16 🙂

Hole 16 (Par 4, 338 yards)

A couple years back Golf Digest called the 16th at Pacific one of the “18 Most Fun Courses Golf Courses in America.” 

While it’s certainly no stretch to say that, I’m not sure it’s quite as much fun as some of the other holes at Bandon.

Pacific Dunes is a Top 100 Golf Course in Bandon, Oregon



Hole 17 (Par 3, 189 yards)

The 4th and final par 3 on the back 9.

Playing about 180 from our tees I thought my 5 iron would be plenty of club – not so much. You don’t want to go short as you have a difficult and potentially steep up and down, but if you’re too long, you’re in the gorse. Don’t try and be a hero, just get it on the green.

Pacific Dunes is a Top 100 Golf Course in Bandon, Oregon

Hole 18 (Par 5, 575 yards)

While I’ve heard many people say that Pacific lacks a good opening and closing hole, I don’t necessarily agree.



I think this par 5 is a really visually interesting hole, that can be difficult the first time you play it (or every other time for that matter). Careful on your approach as there are some pretty terrifying bunkers surrounding the green.

Closing Thoughts

As a whole being at Bandon was even better than I thought it would be (is that possible?). The courses had much more variety than I was expecting, the camaraderie and vibe around the entire complex was unlike anything I’d experienced, and we had unbelievable weather for the trip.

However, there was only one thing that I’d say slightly disappointed me. What was it?

Pacific Dunes.

Don’t get me wrong, the course was phenomenal. The ocean views, unparalleled.  But, there were a couple reasons I wasn’t as wowed quite as much as I was expecting.



The first? While we were there the greens were in pretty rough shape. They were slow and pretty grown out – something I wasn’t expecting. Obviously playing on fescue is very different than most golf in North America, but the greens were in by far the worst shape of any of the other courses.

The other reason I was slightly let down, is partially because the other courses were all so good – namely Bandon Trails.

The inland course which is always rated the lowest on major polls of the Bandon Courses was actually my favorite.

I thought it had the most fun and unique holes, was in great shape, and wasn’t at all hindered by the forest landscape.

I was expecting Pacific to be far and away a better course than Trails, and it wasn’t, or at least I didn’t think so.

So while I loved all of the courses there, I think the reason I found myself slightly disappointed was because comparatively everything else was still so good. Talk about a high quality problem.

That being said, have you been to Bandon Dunes? I’d love your feedback on whether or not Pacific was your favorite?

In the meantime, I think I need another round to give a proper rating. Guess I should go back next month 🙂

Yep, that’s happening."
35,Prairie Dunes,top100,"Hutchinson, KS","Perry Maxwell, 1937/Press Maxwell, 1957",1937,Perry’s Nine,Andy Johnson,rev035_prairie_dunes_1,"It was 100 degrees outside. Since we had already walked 36 holes in the past 22 hours, we agreed that a change of pace was in order. We decided to try some time travel. We were at Prairie Dunes Country Club in Hutchinson, Kansas. Both that morning and the previous evening, we had played 18-hole rounds. All the while, in the distance, there was a low, continual din of shouting and splashing. The heat had driven a crowd of local kids to the club pool. At times, sweating in my hat and collared shirt, I almost envied them. Almost, I say, because the golf was so good. Perry Maxwell, the great Oklahoma-based architect, built the first nine holes at Prairie Dunes in 1937. Twenty years later, his son Press completed the course, but he didn’t simply build the new nine on a separate piece of land. Rather, he added three holes to the west side of the clubhouse and six to the east. In doing so, he followed his father’s plans, though there is some doubt as to how faithful he was. Today, the old version of Prairie Dunes—consisting of Nos. 1, 2, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 17, and 18—sits embedded within the modern one. A few of these holes are not only the best on the course but among the finest anywhere. Our time-traveling notion on that hot afternoon was simple: to play Perry Maxwell’s original nine.
Minimalism—by necessity and preference

The less of man’s handiwork the better a course. – Perry Maxwell Like Southern Hills, Perry Maxwell’s tour de force of championship golf in Tulsa, Prairie Dunes was a product of the Great Depression. Maxwell drew up 18 holes, but he ended up building only nine. The construction itself, headed by his brother-in-law Dean Woods, was a model of thrift. They hired men through the Works Progress Administration, used rudimentary equipment, and moved a bare minimum of earth. This approach happened to suit Maxwell just fine, as he believed in low-cost minimalism with a kind of evangelistic zeal. Speaking to The American Golfer in 1935, he said, “It is my theory that nature must precede the architect, in the laying out of links. It is futile to attempt the transformation of wholly inadequate acres into an adequate course. Invariably the result is the inauguration of an earthquake. The site of a golf course should be there, not brought there. Many an acre of magnificent land has been utterly destroyed by the steam shovel, throwing up its billows on earth, biting out traps and bunkers, transposing landmarks that are contemporaries of Genesis.” These convictions of Maxwell’s were as much financial as they were aesthetic. His trips to Great Britain persuaded him that American golf was mired in unsustainable addictions. As he put it his American Golfer interview, “[T]he majority of American golf clubs are in the red, gore of the steam shovel, blood drawn by the mound-builders. We have learned nothing from Scotland or England where the ancient and honorable game can be enjoyed on marvelous links at one tenth the admission fees, dues, green fees, etc., that prevail in the land of the free.” Maxwell’s spartan methods were well suited to tough times, and in the 1930s, when many other golf architects stopped working, he continued to design and build courses. In 1935, Maxwell met with the Carey family about building a course on the outskirts of Hutchinson, Kansas. Depending on which historical account you believe, either Maxwell spotted or the Careys showed him a stunning tract of Ice Age-forged dunesland east of town. Beneath the wild grasses, yucca, sandhill plum, and cottonwood trees, he must have recognized the undulations, large and small, that would make for compelling golf.
Since Maxwell preferred not to design from maps, he spent a month simply walking the property. “You see,” his son Press said, “he had so much ground to work with that he wanted to see it all, and from all directions. He didn’t design courses from maps. He went out in the field because he wanted to be right in the place where the game was to be played.” It was around this time that Maxwell delivered his most reprinted line: “There are 118 holes here, and all I have to do is eliminate 100.” The construction methods were rustic. Under the supervision of Dean Woods, whom Press referred to as “an old fellow who was opposed to the use of tractors,” the WPA crew built Prairie Dunes quickly and cheaply in the first half of 1937. As Mal Elliott writes in his book Perry Maxwell’s Prairie Dunes, “The construction of the course was done with teams of horses and mules, 18 in all, and slips and Fresno scrapers and wheelbarrows. There was not one piece of mechanized equipment except for the Model T and Model A Fords and trucks which took the workers to the site. The greens and fairways were cleared and scraped by teams dragging plows and scoops. The roots of native grass and weeds were all removed by hand, one wheelbarrowful at a time.”

Using simple methods at the Prairie Dunes construction site

The result was a course that, to this day, meshes humbly yet artfully with the landscape. The transitions between the manmade and the natural—the “tie-ins,” as modern architects call them—are nearly imperceptible. When Perry’s nine opened in September 1937, knowledgeable golfers, including Walker Cupper Johnny Dawson, saw it for what it was: the best nine-hole course in America. (For the historical narrative above, I relied on three books: Mal Elliott’s Perry Maxwell’s Prairie Dunes; Christopher Clouser’s The Midwest Associate; and Anthony Pioppi’s To the Nines. All are excellent reads.)
Perry’s nine

When we set out to rediscover Perry’s nine that afternoon in late June, we knew we weren’t the first. Anthony Pioppi, for one, had played the original course in preparation for his book To the Nines. Also, the members of Prairie Dunes Country Club are well aware of the distinction between the “Perry holes” and the “Press holes,” and I’m sure many of them have taken a crack at the old nine. Nor did we intend our experiment as a slight to Press Maxwell’s work. While the Perry holes are generally better (“Press did not have the imagination and vision his father had,” Jake Carey told Pioppi), the Press holes would be standouts anywhere else. A few of them, especially the slanting, tempting par-4 14th, are among my favorites on the course. Still, as we discovered, there is a special rhythm and coherence to Perry’s nine that you can appreciate only by playing it in its 1937 sequence.
Hole No. 1
1937: par 4, 415 yards
Today: par 4, 452 yards
The tough opening hole swings to the left, into the prevailing wind, daring you to cut the corner to get a shorter approach. The real fun starts at the green. From the 1930s to the present day, golf writers have spoken of “Maxwell’s rolls,” and this green is a good example of why. Here, instead of simple tiers, you see ripples that rise to a point and fall away. This style of contouring raises the stakes of the shots played into, around, and on the green: if your ball finds the correct side of a “roll,” it will collect toward the pin; if it doesn’t, it will swerve away.

Hole No. 2
1937: par 3, 140 yards
Today: par 3, 164 yards
Benched into the property’s main ridge of dunes, the 2nd is an imposing target, even if it sits only 140 (or from today’s back tees, 164) yards away. The green points to about 10 o’clock, asking for a left-to-right shot shape. The wind, however, tends to push the ball to the right, toward a back bunker where, I can assure you, you do not want to be.

After finishing on the 2nd green, we made our first deviation from the modern routing of the course. Instead of hiking up to today’s 3rd tee, we took a path to the left, through the “gunsch.” It was a stirring walk.

Hole No. 6 (formerly No. 3)
1937: par 4, 335 yards
Today: par 4, 387 yards
Right away, we saw that the forward tee of the 6th hole must have been the main tee of the original 3rd. From there, the hole unfurls around a big bunker on the left. Beyond this intimidating hazard, there is an area of maintained rough from which a sightline opens to the left portion of the crowned green. A fairway bunker on the right guards the other decent look at various pins. From the middle of the fairway, your view is obstructed by a flashed bunker that appears to abut the putting surface but is in fact 13 yards short.

The current 6th is one of several holes at Prairie Dunes that would benefit from fairway expansion. Pushing the mowing lines to the outer edges of both fairway bunkers would bring the best, riskiest options back into play.

Advantageous angles from the rough on the 6th hole at Prairie Dunes. Note also the modern back tee (bottom right) and the path to the forward tee from the 2nd green. (Google Earth)

On other holes, especially today’s Nos. 9, 17, and 18, rough has encroached on safe but less strategically desirable sides of the playing corridors. In those places, the longer grass is unnecessary;  the poor angles should be the main penalty. Unlikely as it seems, then, Prairie Dunes, one of the greatest courses anywhere, could be even better. From the 6th green, we walked straight back to another original tee that now serves as a forward tee. It’s a peaceful spot. A pair of cottonwood trees provide shade, encouraging a moment of reflection.

Hole No. 7 (formerly No. 4)
1937: par 4, 440 yards
Today: par 5, 512 yards
The 7th hole is now a short par 5, but Maxwell designed it as a long par 4. Once you find the fairway, you can either lay up to a generous area short of the green-side bunkers or trust your downwind approach to hold a green surrounded by treacheries of undulation, sand, and shrubbery.

Hole No. 8 (formerly No. 5)
1937: par 4, 395 yards
Today: par 4, 468 yards
The best known hole at Prairie Dunes tumbles over some of the most impressive terrain on the property—huge, lurching waves of land. The usual left-to-right wind diverts tee shots toward a stretch of gunsch where, if you find your ball, you will have no view of the green and no real hope of hitting it. Only with a powerful drive will you avoid a blind second shot. Even then, you will likely be hitting from an awkward lie to a severely canted green perched high in the sand hills. This is golf as pure adventure.

Hole No. 9 (formerly No. 6)
1937: par 4, 400 yards
Today: par 4, 452 yards
If the 8th hole shows off the Hutchinson dunesland at its most dramatic, the 9th emphasizes its subtler contours. A closely mown swale to the left of the green influences tactics all the way back to the tee. To be able to aim your approach away from this hollow instead of toward it, your tee shot has to ride the wind to the left side of the fairway without sailing into a large, gnarly bunker. The more you hedge away from this hazard, the worse the angle of your second shot becomes. Complicating matters, toward the safe, right side of the fairway, the undulations grow bigger, increasing the likelihood of a lie that will conspire with the wind to force your approach left, toward that green-side basin.

Hole No. 10 (formerly No. 7)
1937: par 3, 160 yards
Today: par 3, 185 yards
Like the 7th hole, the 10th runs with the prevailing wind. And as on the 7th, Maxwell tests your ability to hold the green by placing bunkers short. When the pin is on the right, you have two options: 1) drop a downwind mid-iron just past the bunker on the right and somehow keep it from running through, or 2) go left and accept the inevitability of a triple-breaking, 60-foot lag putt. When I think of a prototypical scalloped Maxwell green, this one comes to mind. From the devilish hummock center-right, to the merciful central channel, to the repelling edges front left and back left, every section makes for delightful chipping and putting.

Hole No. 17 (formerly No. 8)
1937: par 5, 510 yards
Today: par 5, 523 yards
Here is where our time travel briefly failed: Maxwell’s original tee was just behind the 10th green, and the tee shot played diagonally across the dune ridge between Nos. 17 and 18. There was visible room to the left, but position A was to the right of the hog’s back in the fairway, blind from the tee and close to death in the prairie grass. From there, you had a chance to go for the narrow, elevated green, guarded by bunkers left and a drop-off right. We were unable to hit from the original teeing ground, however. In expanding the course to 18 holes, Press moved the 17th tee to the east. Now it is a straightaway hole—still excellent, but not as fun.

Hole No. 18 (formerly No. 9)
1937: par 4, 370 yards
Today: par 4, 390 yards
While relatively short, this finishing hole, Perry’s 9th, is a culminating trial of nerve. As on the No. 17, the garden spot is on the right, but a strong right-to-left slope makes it hard to hit. Also, since this section of the fairway is concealed form the tee, and since the wind presses scarily toward the dunes on the right, a bailout to the left just feels better. It results, however, in a blind approach that would have been even more uncomfortable when the bunker pit short of the green had sand in it. As a finishing hole for match play, No. 18 at Prairie Dunes is ideal. It can yield birdies as readily as X’s.

The course of time

We finished Perry’s nine as evening advanced, and in spite of the heat, we felt invigorated. In our morning round that day, we had taken in the full breadth of 21st-century Prairie Dunes by playing all 18 holes from the tips. Even at a “mere” 6,900 yards, it felt (at least to me) like a championship brute. The green-to-tee walks were long, backwards, and frequently uphill. From the elevated back tees, I found my field of vision dominated by gunsch rather than short grass. It was a great, stern examination of golfing ability. We anticipated that Perry’s nine would be a different experience, but we didn’t know how different. Rather than a test, it felt like a charming adventure. As we followed the old transitions from hole to hole, the routing fit together like a puzzle. It returned to the clubhouse three different times, offering moments of respite before lighting out again for the dunes. The original landing zones came into focus, inspiring one of us to pull the head cover off his persimmon driver. Our imaginations wandered continually back to 1937: in the middle of a vast continent, an ideal course on ideal land, with wind—sometimes mild, sometimes fierce—generating variety day to day… Golf courses wear their histories, some better than others. At Prairie Dunes, time has been generous. The modern 18-hole course is wonderful, but within it sits my favorite nine-hole course in America, lovely and exacting and resilient, still available to the adventurous."

The course, or at least 9 holes, opened for play in 1937 and Perry Maxwell laid them out. Maxwell believed absolutely that “the golf course should be there, not brought there,” and he surveyed the 480-acre site day after day for weeks before making any decision on the routing. Perry’s son, James Press Maxwell extended the course to 18 holes in 1956.

Naturally, the end result is a course that is natural, and although there’s no salty taste of the sea on your lips, there’s everything else that is essential to make a perfect day’s golf. First of all there is sand and sand to spare, secondly there is the ever present Kansas wind – the energy from which is being harnessed liberally across the state – thirdly the land pitches and rolls in a delightful seaside style and fourthly the holes are designed in a thoughtful, cunning and strategic fashion. The sum of this is pure golfing heaven.

Writing in Tom Doak's Little Red Book of Golf Course Architecture, the author commented as follows: ""What makes Prairie Dunes special is the severity of the greens and the wonderful choice of green sites. Interestingly there are a lot of uphill approach shots, which a lot of people don't love and some don't like about my own work, but those green sites are what makes the course challenging. It's also a special place in terms of atmosphere... it takes some effort to get there, but they are always so hospitable to people who have made the trip to see them, and they are really humble about what a good course it is because they aren't there to impress anybody, they are there to enjoy it themselves.""

Prairie Dunes is a private club and casual green fees are not accepted. If you want to experience this stunning inland links course (renovated by Bill Coore and Ben Crenshaw in 2004) and you are willing to make the long journey to Hutchinson Kansas, we suggest you ask your home club to prepare a letter of introduction. Who knows you might find yourself teeing it up at the 1st “Carey Lane”."

“At least we know the PrecisionAire works.” The relentless rain poured the entire time. Two rain jackets and three sets of gloves later, at some point I just accepted I would be soaked the rest of the round. Every step was a slosh of water from the shoe. A gust of wind would greet us every now and then, my body would shiver with the cold reflexively. It certainly wasn’t warm. The mixture of cold and constant rain was too much for most every other group, who finally started their march off the course. We offered that option to our member host but he wouldn’t hear of it. We were finishing the round even if a tsunami hit us. Besides, at least we know the PrecisionAire works.
There was a perverse focus out there that day. I loved the course, what I was seeing and how it played. I was playing well as an added bonus, the 2 iron of all clubs obeying my commands and cutting through the water before running as far forward as it could. And indeed, the PrecisionAire was working, the greens rolling terrifically well while the fairways stayed in nice order. It was the rough where the rain imparted its harshness. That wet rough, almost like hitting out of a wet shag carpet, would wrestle the club head from you with evil motive. My flight left in a few hours and I had no idea how I would even dry off, as the course was still dealing with a devastating fire, destroying one of the iconic clubhouses in the game. There was no locker room to speak of. I ignored all of it. None of it mattered while I was out there, taking in the course, interacting with it. The impressiveness of all the green space, rolling and heaving, much more enjoyable and sophisticated than I was expecting. I was glad our host shared that same tenacity. It’s only water, it’s only cold. There are more important matters at hand.
It was by far the wettest and likely most extreme weathered round of golf I have played. And one of my favorite of the season.
After the round, I managed to change in the pool house, where heat lamps were put out. I stood next to one, almost hoping my hair would catch fire for the warmth. A glass of bourbon in hand, its nourishing warmness nipping away the cold. I then bid adieu and found a grocery store, where I snagged a few plastic bags. I took all my wet apparel, put them in the bags and shoved everything in my golf bag. All I could do was hope I would get home in time to dry everything before rust or mold started in. I finally began to defrost as the rental car blasted heat on the way to the airport. By the time I was at the airport sitting at a bar with some soup, I was already back to normal, relishing the two days of extraordinary golf I had, already comparing and contrasting Oakland Hills to the other great Ross courses I have played. Already realizing the place surpassed anything I was expecting.
The Monster. Monster Monster Monster Monster Monster Monster Monster Monster. Monster. MonSter. MonsTer. Monster Monster. mOnSter. Ok we got that out of the way. The course is famous for how Ben Hogan characterized it after his U.S. Open victory in 1951, that legacy forever enshrined from then on. A venerable tournament venue, one of the nation’s anchors of the game. Host of the 1924, 1937, 1951, 1961, 1985 and 1996 U.S. Opens, the 1972, 1979 and 2008 PGA Championships, 2002 and 2016 U.S. Amateur, 1981 and 1991 U.S. Senior Open, 1929 U.S. Women’s Amateur and 2004 Ryder Cup. Now set to host the 2034 and 2051 U.S. Opens, 2024 U.S. Junior Amateur, 2029 U.S. Women’s Amateur, 2038 U.S. Girl’s Junior Amateur and 2047 U.S. Amateur. There is no doubt the course is championship worthy. Hogan anointed its challenge decades ago and the history of these competitions are the rubric of America’s golf folklore. The legacy is self evident.
So what happens when the clubhouse is in tragic ruins, the trophies, memorabilia, regalia, no where to be found and the rains wash away the crowds? What happens when it’s nothing but you, the course and the elements? The course has no where to hide, that’s what. You find out a lot about it, as well as yourself. An infinite baptism as the skies flooded, the rawness of self, course and game laid bare by and by as we went on. And it came to be the last thing on my mind was the Monster. Or the trophies, championships, and legends that had walked and played the same fairways and greens as I. It was Donald Ross. And yes, Hanse. And all the green hills and slopes and. . . greens. The creeks and shrines of sand. The rain wore on, the waters washed but in the end, the genius remained. Aye, the genius, that’s what I was after.
In 1916, Donald Ross began here. Essex County had just been completed and Number 2 was 10 years old. Seminole was a few years off, as was Aronimink, while he worked on Inverness at the same time as here. The original design featured an array of diagonal cross bunkering that enhanced strategic plays of angles depending on how the golfer confronted the bunkering. The land stretched every which way with a nice balance of openness and well placed trees. Even in its early days, it was one of the longest courses of its time, just over 6,800 yards for the 1924 USO. This grand scale of Ross remained for the 1937 USO as well. Then came the 1951 USO, and the USGA and Robert Trent Jones . . . and the Monster. It’s important to note what RTJ did and didn’t do as part of his work in transforming the course for that major. He did move bunkers so they were in play at the tee landing areas, he did increase bunkering around the greens to create a more precision aerial exam and he did change the Eighth and Eighteenth into par 4’s, only a parcel of yards shorter than their par 5 yardages. And yes, he added trees. Lots of them, narrowing those playing corridors to surgical strike levels. RTJ did not, however, touch the greens or the routing. Yes he toughened the course by reducing acceptable lanes of play and landing areas, all but eliminating the ground game. But the touchstone of Ross splendor, the routing and greens, remained.
Rees followed in his father’s footsteps, focusing on bunkers and narrowing. He deepened them and further constricted playing corridors. The course was a stiff, mostly one dimensional test where long, straight and aerial were required for a good score. There were no options, there was little strategy. You could either hit the shot or not. Otherwise, you paid a stiff price. Yet like his father, the routing and greens remained.
“If it’s cold, windy and rainy I’m out.” Gil Hanse apparently wouldn’t have joined us that day. A professional wuss who happens to design golf courses, he, Jim Wagner, and their team came in to do their thing. My article “Golden Gil” https://golfadelphia.com/2019/12/27/golden-gil/ quoted Hanse discussing his work here: “We’re undertaking a restoration of the South Course at Oakland Hills. Donald Ross did the original, of course, and it was Robert Trent Jones who did the renovation that created “The Monster” Ben Hogan conquered in winning the 1951 U.S. Open. Rees Jones later revised his father’s work. The plan is to restore kind of a hybrid of the Ross and Jones designs, the best elements of each. The course will be closed for nearly two years beginning in 2019, but when we’re finished, without a doubt it will be a Monster again, albeit one a little different than the one Hogan brought to its knees.” Hanse’s goal was to actually toughen the course by shifting the challenge it presented while making it more fun and accessible for the everyday golfer. Gil widened entry points to greens and reinvigorated the absolutely world class ground game that can be had here. He also opened up the course significantly, allowing the terrain to once again flourish, which uncapped all of the strategy and options that were incorporated into the land long ago by Ross. While the greens had never been re-shaped, they had shrunken over the years so Gil expanded them to their original size, brought them to USGA specification and installed PrecisionAire systems under each. The hum of those systems during my round in concert with the rain drops was enough to lull me to lay down in one of those golden bunkers and rest my eyes for a spell. This process with the greens meant each was laser surveyed and scanned three-dimensionally, then cored. RTJ2 has decried the work to the greens as a ruination but it’s typical nowadays, and necessary for long term preservation considerations. Works of art undergo similar processes, as do classic cars and houses. The Seventh green was relocated to its original place along with the creek. Bunkers were reduced in numbers but increased in size. With all of this, Gil paid mind to narrowing the fairways where the tour players would land their tee shots, embracing the Jones’ stiffening concept, while widening others where it made sense depending on the contours. This was done while restoring the cross bunker configurations, instead of having each fairway flanked by bunkers on each side.
I’m contrarian by nature and have no problem admitting there are times I get sick of hearing about Hanse. Hanse this, Hanse that, Hanse is coming to work his magic, Hanse shows up all smart, charming and humble, everyone loves Hanse. We get it. And while I enjoyed Gil’s work at other Ross courses like Plainfield and Aronimink, I was only lukewarm to the more recent Pinehurst 4. All of this hesitancy dissipated as I was playing here, however. Gil, Wagner and their team really did some special work. It took me by surprise, grabbed me by the collars and shook hard. At first I noticed the bunker sizes and just how large they actually were. That naturally led to views beyond the bunkers where the fairway, rough and greens seem to bounce along for miles. The concepts of width at places like Sand Hills, Rolling Hills and even Pinehurst 2 were here in a similar type of application. The terrain is sophisticated in its natural typography and now the golfer is free to use it as he wishes, yet the strategy in how to go about it, as well as the wickedly deceptive greens that seem easy enough until you see the ball roll unpredictably is what the course does so well now. The ground game was indeed extraordinary, one of the better I have come across recently. Bradley Klein wrote so eloquently and spot on of the course, “Now you see open, rolling terrain with much larger swaths of sand along a powerful horizontal scale. Much of that is due to Ross’s routing. It makes use of certain nodal points that gather in a kind of golf energy and concentrate one’s attention”. Yes!
The course was a delight in how you had so many choices at each shot and were never truly out of a hole no matter how poor the last shot. There are very few absolute penal elements such as out of bounds, large water or other forced carries. Most of the time, one is met with the mammoth bunkers, the mischievous rough or the hills, where one may need to deal with unfortunate lies or blind shots when out of position. The golfer never stops golfing. There’s also so much green and grass to work with which is a double-edged sword. Those who may simply come up woefully short on their approach at least have the wide entry point and green to coax the next shot close. Those who end up woefully sideways may wish they were put out of their misery with a drop or stroke and distance. The scale and width did indeed create a particular golf energy Klein refers to above. No longer a course of despair, the golfer stays engaged no matter what. There’s so many opportunities for redemption, it is inevitable. I was expecting more of a championship venue focusing on that long and straight mantra, but Oakland Hills South is so much more. It’s a dramatic and fascinating member’s course that could host a major with not much more than a day’s notice.
It breaks in to my top 10.
I long for the day I am able to get here under better circumstances. Perhaps with the sunlight spreading to those green hills and a few foursomes here and there leisurely walking the fairways, complimenting those well-hit shots while lamenting the others. Some time, the clubhouse will return in its Georgian magnificence framing the whole scene while the creeks will be much tamer, trickling here and there, quietly. Yet it is during the times of duress one gets a keen sense of the true nature of man, or golf course for that matter. So many months removed from the rain, cold and wind, I’m grateful to see the course in such circumstances. We got to look deep into the character of the other.
The First is a 428 yard par 4 (from the Blues). A slightly elevated tee shot opens up the round and the bunkers introduce their presence early on, making sure you understand their dominant role. Visually, it appears as if the bunkers crowd the fairway but once among them on ground level, you begin to see how much space there actually is. The fairway narrows a bit between the tee landing area and the green at which point it widens once again. That first green runs back to front with a diagonal shelf running in the center. The ball just rolls. The greens are large and at times it seems as if there is no amount of space or time that can get the ball across them and into the hole, but adjusting to the scale is part of the experience here.

The green
The Second is a 511 yard par 5. Like the First, bunkers dominate the viewscape from the tee. It seems inevitable hitting into them but focusing on carrying the center ones directly in front will find fairway easily for most tee shots. Indeed, once we reach the fairway, we see the river of green flowing up to the green while a barrage of sand comes at us from the left. After some narrowing a bit further ahead, the green is on top of the hill with the fairway feeding right into it.

The Second

A bit shorter
The Third is a 190 yard par 3. A nice 4-5-3 start has us around the world quickly. The brilliance of the bunker positioning throughout the round comes out here a little bit more with the center bunker at an angle. This creates those visual issues with depth perception that were evident on the prior two holes while ensuring a bail out short isn’t a guaranteed safe shot. It also obscures just how much room there is at the front of the green to play with. A large bunker flanks the green on the entire left side while a smaller albeit riskier on is on the right. The green is wide and set at an angle, running towards that large left bunker.

The Third


Just short of the green

To the left
The Fourth is a 424 yard par 4. Moving to the a corner of the property, the fairway starts to turn and fall to the left at the tee shot landing area. Bunkers are on either side and in play off the tee, first right then left. Like the tee shots we’ve seen thus far, this one is semi blind and keeps us slightly off kilter. The green is below the fairway and most every approach will be coming in from above. The entry point is as welcome as come be, so even those out of position can at least ponder whether there’s a way to feed the ball on. Of course, hitting the green is only half of it; the other is using the flat stick to navigate the wondrous world of those fast moving careening greens.

The Fourth

The green coming into view

The green
The Fifth is a 430 yard par 4. Another off kilter tee shot that falls below us slightly. A large bunker on the left warns us to avoid that side but it is the most advantageous approach angle, so getting as close as possible without going in is a good idea. The fairway then ends at a creek and picks up on the other side. It’s a touch approach no matter where you are. The bunkers dominate visually, with a larger one taking up a lot of the space on the right, then there is a small center line one sliced into the space just short of the green and another off to the left. The golfer may be tempted to carry all of this to the rear of the green but the back side is no good and will be left with a green rocketing away from them. That center line bunker also complicates any ground game proposition. It’s possible, but aerial precision is probably best, or laying up short and doubling down on one’s ability to get up and down could be smart depending on where the second shot is from. It’s a tougher hole, a transition of sorts from the warm introduction of the opening quartet, walking from our host’s parlor to the bar area for a round of shots. How we handle that change in hospitality will unfold over the next few holes.

The Fifth

The right side, beginning of the fairway

After the creek approach shot territory
The Sixth is a 344 yard par 4. A shorter par 4 all uphill where the gargantuan bunkers assert their presence. The right center bunker strongly suggests something less than driver off the tee. There’s also a larger bunker to the left and about the same distance out that suggests the same. Strategically, the golfer can decide to lay up short of the bunkers or take them on for a shorter approach and missing off to the right isn’t the worst thing either, but even short of the bunkers will end up being a short iron into the green. The green moves like a tidal wave back to front and left to right, the movement of which should be considered in every shot where the ball will land on to it.

The Sixth

Approach shot territory

The rear
The Seventh is a 369 yard par 4. The host now expects us to be well acquainted and pleasantries are well behind us. It is time to address any pressing matters, the staff instructed to keep out as things get sorted out as needed. The bend of the creek among the hills is used brilliantly here. First, it crosses the fairway at the start and at an angle, so the further right the tee shot, the further it must go to carry. How the creek cuts across the higher portion of the fairway and turns on the right side, however, means any tee shot on that side will need to avoid two separate section of the creek and carry even longer that if one simply ends up left to left center. In other words. Do not go fucking right off the tee. The three bunkers off to the left may steer one away from that side but if I were to play this hole again, I would embrace that left side, away from the creek. The creek comes in from the back left of the green and moves alongside it, across the fairway altogether until reaching the right side of the tee landing area I just so eloquently described, before moving back towards center and cutting across the fairway yet again. Alas, the approach will likely need to carry the creek where it crosses the fairway on the high portion, near the green. The green itself is almost like a hillside running as fast as the creek itself downwards. Anything above the hole becomes exponentially tougher to handle. The configuration of the creek, bunkers, contours and green, and its impact of visuals, depth perception and playing structure is fascinating. I can’t even tell which of the 15 strokes I enjoyed most here.

The Seventh

Looking back

Looking back at the rear of the green
The Eighth is a 460 yard par 5. We continue the march uphill, gently yet firmly. This is possibly the first tee shot we have a chance to see the fairway laid out before us from the tee. The bunkers remain large and looming on both sides and while the tee shot may seem as futile as filling up a bucket with drops of water, we relent and hit it anyways. The fairway ripples and climbs to the green, which climbs even more steeply towards it. Thank goodness we have an extra shot here to set up the approach. There are a series of bunkers up the left side we need to avoid and the right side opens up the entry point and green, yet it takes that extra stroke to get over there and take advantage. Firm yet gentle is apt here. The hole never feels like a brute yet some how its scale and climb start to wear on the golfer and he trudges up the hill to the green. The Monster. Instead of a more direct slaughtering as many faced before, perhaps now that monster is more of a silent killer that intrudes slowly without our knowing, like stress or cholesterol. My par here felt like I wrestled the world to its knees, before I realized we had most of the round to go.

The Eighth

Looking back
The Ninth is a 219 yard par 3. The longer par 3 carries over swaths of rough and a grouping of bunkers shared with the First with the practice green and clubhouse in the background. The area before the green may be tempting to hedge on but the bunker in the center keeps everyone honest to go for the green instead. There is some safety towards the rear of the green more or less, which could be used to get the ball move back towards the front, but that will need to be a very healthy long and true shot in. As with most holes we have encountered thus far, there is a lot more room between and amongst the bunkers than appears at first blush.

Taken from the practice green, the tees are on the hill to the right of the path
The front nine does well in looping around efficiently while playing with the assorted creeks and hills as brilliantly as possible. There is no quirk, there is no eye popping intimidation or penal elements; there is a gentle green giant elegance that simply asserts itself quietly and ensures each shot is plotted out carefully or else the strokes sneak upon us. The sequencing is also of note, starting out in warmer tones before slowly tightening up to the last. Every hole was solid and I am loathe to rank them but if pressed, would say 9, 7, 1, 5, 6, 3, 2, 8, 4.
The back nine starts with the 446 yard par 4 Tenth. At this point, my so-called water proof high tech rain jacket was soaked through. I had a spare in my bag, so put that on but it only held for a few holes as the rain intensified. Most of the back nine would be played in a head to toe sop. I changed one set of rain gloves for another and they too would pool up shortly. So be it. The course was too intriguing to worry about such matters as warmth, dryness or sanity.
A little less width that we have grown accustomed, the bunkers flashing and signaling where the tee shot should go and where it should not. It was immediately apparent to me that the fairway shaping is a lot sharper and pronounced, hills and ridges much more sudden. Indeed, the fairway moves up and down a couple times over some ridges, the approach will likely be on the longer side and possibly a blind shot from a lie you wish could be better. The green is on the same hill as the Eleventh tee, Seventeenth green and Eighteenth tee, Ross using the best parts of the property as much as possible.

The Tenth

A bit closer
The Eleventh is a 415 yard par 4. The fairway funnels between bunkers on both sides before us on the tee, so one must figure out whether to utilize the width of the shorter shot or take on those bunkers in some way. After the bunkers, the fairway actually drops and curves left heading to the green, which is uphill and mostly out of sight. The fairway shaping is dramatic and demands attention, the approach must climb and soar to heights above and the green is deep yet narrow. I found it one of the more challenging approaches.
After you remove your ball from the hole here, take a moment and reflect on how you enjoyed the last couple holes. You just played what Ross felt were his finest consecutive par 4’s ever designed.

The Eleventh

The wonderful fairway shaping

The pin, mocking us from above
The Twelfth is a 520 yard par 5. On top of the same hill as the green from the hole prior, a refreshing panorama of the course reveals itself. Our fairway is on the other side of rough and below, a lone tree on the left and water on the right. Bunkers are then left then right before the fairway widens before the green, which sits just a bit above. Nice and large, it cradles those approaches coming in long and short, moving a few different directions but back to front in general.

The Twelfth

Left side of the fairway

Approach shot territory

A bit shorter

The green

The Thirteenth is a 158 yard par 3. Ross usually liked to have one shorter par 3 on his courses and this is it for here. Surrounded by bunkers and requiring an aerial attack, the green has a lower left and upper right tier to further ensure the tee shot is a sufficient test in accuracy proficiency. The rough is heavy outside of the bunkers, so recovery shots will all be fairly tough, as the golfer still needs to pay attention to the tiers and pin position, even more so since he is already a stroke down.



The green
The Fourteenth is a 472 yard par 4. Yeah, par 4. I’d be lying if I didn’t admit the rain, cold and wet was starting to wear me down a little. I couldn’t get the ball in the air off the tee on the hole prior and trudging through all that wet rough to the green was not fun. A par 4 almost 500 yards was among the things I was not hoping to encounter at that moment. Towels. I became fixated on towels as they danced in my head, just rooms and bales of towels in all their dryness. I knew the tee shot needed to be drilled for a chance to regain some composure. The others in my group got their shots out there, so just copy them. With ran and wind beating on me as I started my backswing, I bore down and walloped one. That’s all I needed. The cold, pain and despair disappeared. After the bunker on the right, the fairway starts falling towards the green. What Ross did brilliantly here is placed many of the fairways against ridges so that a lot of the hole remained suspenseful from the tee. That is certainly the case here. After the ridge, the fairway reveals itself, then widens once again after the fairway bunker on the left. The green is sunken from the fairway and quite wide, likely one of the larger greens of the course. The approach will definitely be on the longer side, yet the green and area before it can be used to get the ball close. Indeed, the flatter ball flight of the two iron was helpful, staying on course then landing and sprinting and jumping towards the green, ending up close enough for me to think about sinking it. It’s a great hole in how its length seems a bit deceptive opposite to what is usually the case; it seemed to play much shorter than the stated yardage.

The Fourteenth

Moving down the fairway

Short approach shot territory

The green

The Fifteenth is a 362 yard par 4. A bit of trees here, especially on the left, guarding the inside of the dog leg. Likewise, pools of bunkers are congregating in the same area, all of it signaling to stay as short as possible off the tee, which then would leave you with miles on the approach. The green is uphill as well, further pressing the issue. The bunkers are a great example of Hanse fusing the old with the new. Ross’ original bunkering at the inside of the turn is there, as well as RTJ’s positioning more towards the center of the fairway, and Rees’ bail out areas off to the right. Those can opt to carry then altogether and getting as close to them as possible is ideal, all of it creating a daunting and thoughtful tee shot. After the turn, a view of the green opens up but the pools of bunkers leading up to it must be accounted for. There is much more room between them than it appears and even more room up at the green. My 2 iron gave me one of the more memorable shots of the round as it carried all of the trouble and settled 10 feet from the pin for a look at birdie, which I missed.

The Fifteenth

Approach shot territory

A bit shorter

Looking back
The Sixteenth is a 406 yard par 4. An elevated tee shot on the same ridge line where the green prior is situated, the fairway and horizon are both laid out before us. The hillside off to the right conceals just how wide the fairway is over there, as well as the water a little further out on that side. Staying left or left center off the tee is ideal. Moving down to the fairway, we see just how large the water is. It’s essentially a small lake and must be carried from pretty much any approach shot to the green. The golfer can decide on a shorter carry over the water at the expense of ending up short of the green, which is below the fairway and makes any of those shots a bit more delicate in trying to avoid crashing into the water.
At first I felt the hole seemed a bit out of place with its demanding forced carry and size of the water hazard, but it’s as Ross designed it. No doubt it brings a different challenge with the finality of that watery grave and towards the end of the round, has the potential to unravel scorecards or matches.

The Sixteenth

Moving down the fairway

The green, on the other side

Short approach
The Seventeenth is a 192 yard par 3. A marvelous longer par 3. The green sits on top of the hill, its immense size concealed from the tee while expansive sandscapes cover a lot of the front and sides of the hill. The rear falls off abruptly into rough with little room behind it. The shot will play much longer than its yardage, with even well hit shots that seem to have enough fall short and rolling back down the hill. There is plenty of room to miss but of course the recoveries up the hill will all come with their assorted complications. A tremendous par 3 where the acumen with the longer clubs in the bag have no where to hide.

The Seventeenth


Looking down at me, in disdain
The Eighteenth is a 487 yard par 5. A longer dog leg right bending around the perimeter of the property back to the clubhouse. The tee shot uses the same hill as the green prior and the Tenth green, Eleventh tee, heading out to one of the more straightforward fairway presentations of the round. The fairway pivots at the right fairway bunker, which is grand in its stature and sets the tone for the rest of the hole. The bunkers gather with more interest closer to the green where the slopes and contours abound, dancing about the larger bunkers and rising up towards the clubhouse. It’s a fitting closing scene, the green serving as the grand subtle stage while those about the clubhouse are the audience. In shivering soaked numbness, only able to manage the most brief, slightest grin, we take our bow and promptly seek the refuge of dry.

Looking back from the green

From the practice green behind
The back nine neatly loops around the other side of the property than the front and has stages of challenge. The opening sequence is tighter with bolder shaping before widening in scale, then length and challenge ramp up before the last, which eases up a touch to allow the golfer a little freedom to handle the accompanying pressures of closing things out respectfully. They are all strong holes, with my ranking of them 17, 15, 11, 14, 18, 10, 12, 13, 16.
“I rarely find a piece of property so well-suited for a golf course.” The sprawling hills with meandering ridges and creeks settling on a great expanse. Always at that proper balance of interest without being too dull or extreme at any point, the land lends itself brilliantly to the game, as Ross recognized way back when. The course is a grand elegance; a parade of dizzying yet pleasant slopes on which the ball arches and careens along the magnificent fairways to the gigantic greens. The fairways climb dramatically and even glide nonchalantly at times to those greens, striking a lively expansive ground game throughout. Hanse and Wagner certainly enhanced the ability of the course to remain a monstrosity of challenge while becoming even more sophisticated and engaging for its members. The challenge has shifted to be sure; the golfer must now heed to the whims of the land and navigate its contours large and small. The behemoths of sand rise and fall rhythmically and must be navigated carefully. The hills and ridges dance in delight, revealing and concealing at their leisure. It’s a wonderful mixture of parkland tenets with the strategy and ground game one usually encounters at the links. It’s a unique, all world identity, one that took me by surprise, joyfully. It has the ability host championships and challenge the game’s greatest in a distinct manner while exuding a wealth of interest that would make any of us want to loop around again and again in engaging splendor.

38,Oakland Hills (South),top100,"Bloomfield Hills, MI",Donald Ross,1917,Oakland Hills (South Course): About as Storied as It Gets,Sean Ogle,rev038_oakland_hills_2,"I wasn’t sure if Oakland Hills was going to happen – but man did I want it to.

One of the most frequently asked questions on the trip was “How did you get on the private courses?”

Medinah was pretty straight forward, Oakland Hills, not so much.

The common answer: “It was a friend of a friends, dad’s business partner’s, business partner” – and that pretty much sums it up.

I’m learning that a big part of the fun of going for the Top 100 is all of the cool people you meet along the way and the interesting circumstances that will have to present themselves in order to get on the courses.

After playing Medinah the week prior, I was kind of expecting Oakland Hills to look a lot like that.  Long winding entrance way with very grandiose feeling, looking grounds.

The reality wasn’t actually quite like that.

When you pull up to Oakland Hills there’s a small sign that says “members only” and then a very short driveway up to the bag drop in front of the back of the club.  The attendant took our clubs and we parked the car and made our way to the mens locker room.

Here you don’t use cell phones, and you don’t put your shoes on in the parking lot – you’re given a locker close to the member who is accompanying you and you do it in there.

The clubhouse at Oakland Hills is hands down the most beautiful I’ve ever been in.  From the locker room to the mens bar to the mixed dining room, it was all first rate.

Our member hadn’t arrived yet, so we made our way to the range which was very nice, but surprisingly short. My first reaction was “I bet the pros could hit it 150 yards past the treeline.” I later found out that during tournaments like the Ryder Cup and PGA Championship that they use part of the North Course for a driving range – along with Parking.

Oakland Hills Country Club is one of the Top 100 Golf Courses in the US
Well manicured, but not exactly long…

Denton showed up about 10 minutes later and we got to know each other a bit before heading to the putting green.

This is when I got scared.  The hole I’d picked to putt on was right at the crest of a hill. I knocked it up there to within an inch, and then watched it roll back down about 15 feet…3 times.  I finally learned I could hit it above the hole and it would roll back down in – that was fun, I just prayed that the entire course wouldn’t be so evil.

I was pretty excited to hit the course as this is my first Donald Ross design  and is one of the most storied golf courses in the world, having hosted:

6 US Opens (1924, 1937, 1951, 1961, 1985, 1996)
3 PGA Championships (1972, 1979, 2008)
US Senior Open (1981, 1991)
US Amateur (2002)
Ryder Cup (2004)
If that isn’t an unbelievable collection of tournaments – I don’t know what is.

For everyone’s sanity we decided to play the white tees, which still measured 6,512 yards.

And with that we stepped up the to the first tee on the 20th best course in the US.

Front Nine at Oakland Hills South Course:

Let’s do this thing.

Hole 1 (Par 4, 382 yards)

What you immediately notice about the first hole at Oakland Hills is just how narrow the fairways are.  Bunkers within reach surround both sides and just beyond that are trees.

We all sprayed our drives a bit, and mine was what appeared to be the least damaging lying just off the fairway in the rough.  This was until we walked down and checked out the rough.  Thick.  Immaculately maintained, but thick.

After having what was probably the best warm up I’d ever had, it was as though I’d forgotten how to play golf on this first hole.  May have been because the gravity of the course I was playing had finally sunk in.

A triple bogey is not how you want to start off when playing one of those “once in a lifetime” rounds.

Hole 2 (Par 5, 485 yards)

A shorter par 5 dogleg left, but not one I was even remotely thinking of going for in 2 as my goal now was just to keep the ball in play and try and make some pars.

The tee shot is slightly blind with heavy bunkering along the left and at the dogleg on the right.  Best shot is to keep it left center of the fairway, and then play smart shots all the way into the bunkered and elevated green.

Hole 3 (Par 3, 164 yards)

The first par 3 on the course was also the site of one of my best shots of the trip.

I pulled out a 6 iron and picked an aggressive line directly over the front bunker.  I cleared it by about 2 feet and the ball must have rolled within an inch of pin, stopping about 2 feet away.  Putt in for birdie.

This is one of those times where you can’t help but think “I bet at some point during a tournament Jack didn’t make birdie on this hole…”  Nevermind the fact the pros were probably an extra 50 yards back.

Hole 4 (Par 4, 410 yards)

Another dogleg left with a narrow fairway. Slightly downhill approach with heavy bunkering.

Hole 5 (Par 4, 394 yards)

This was the point where I was starting to get concerned about all the dogleg lefts, which definitely do not play well to my fade.  My driver was off all day, and this was one of the worst examples of it, slicing it hard and almost getting it to the 6th fairway.  A creek runs through at about 280 out which on this day wasn’t reachable for any of us.

There was a lot of extra room around the fairway and green here, I can only imagine the masses on a tournament day.

Hole 6 (Par 4, 343 yards)

One of my favorite holes on the front 9.  Similar to 11 on the back, this is a short par 4 with bunkers everywhere, and you guessed it, yet again another narrow fairway.  3 wood or iron is the play here, as you don’t want to be in any of the bunkers on this course.

Hole 7 (Par 4, 358 yards)

If you’re not driving the ball well, this is a scary hole. Water all along the right and bunkers all down the left.  I played 3 wood and landed it middle of the fairway about 140 out.  It felt longer from the tee than it actually played.

Hole 8 (Par 5, 462 yards)

Short par 5, but don’t mistake that as easy.  Straight away with very narrow fairway, bunkers everywhere and a pretty severely elevated green. Play 3 smart shots here, and this could be a good birdie opportunity.  Long is better than short on the approach as those bunkers are exactly where you don’t want to be.



During tournaments the course plays at a par of 70, this hole along with 18 are turned into par 4s.

Hole 9 (Par 3, 196 yards)

My second attempt at a hole in one on the course.  The bartender at the bar we were at the night before said “Remember, on 9 it may look shorter, but you’ll need all of the distance on this one and probably an extra club more.”

Playing 205 out, I heeded his advice and opted for my 3 hybrid.  I wish I had a photo of where the ball landed – 3 inches to the left of the pin.  It stopped about 4 feet from the pin and in all of my nervous glory I missed the putt and settled for par.

Back Nine on the South Course at Oakland Hills:

The back 9 is well, just as tough as the front…

Hole 10 (Par 4, 418 yards)

They don’t make things any easier once you swing around to the back. I learned this the hard way. I was flying high after shooting a 43 on the front and playing some of the best golf of the trip.

The back 9 would be a different story entirely.

A long par 4 with a fairway that sloped in just about every direction imaginable.

Also notice that one tree on the left, if you ever see it, tell it I want my ball back. There aren’t many places at Oakland Hills to hit it in the trees – but apparently I was determined to find every single one of them.

Hole 11 (Par 4, 384 yards)

Possibly my favorite hole on the course. Short par 4 with an S-Curve fairway and elevated green. Pop it over the left bunker to get some roll down to the base of the fairway and have a relatively short approach.

Hole 12 (Par 5, 526 yards)

Fun par 5 that requires a smart 2nd shot. Bunkers on the left and trees on the right with a sharp dogleg.  You probably won’t reach the dog leg off your drive, but aim to the left side of the fairway to give yourself the best angle at getting close after 2.

Depending on where you are you can cut the corner over the trees to get it closer to the green, but unless the pin placement is left, it probably won’t do you a whole lot of good. Elevated green with lots of fun bunkering.

Hole 13 (Par 3, 152 yards)

Hit the green or else.  That’s pretty much all there is to say about this par 3. If you aren’t on the green, you probably won’t be liking where you do find yourself.

Oakland Hills Country Club is one of the Top 100 Golf Courses in the US

Hole 14 (Par 4, 448 yards)

The #2 handicap hole and the only one that I would say is just plain unfair.  Measuring 456 yards (or just 20 yards shorter than a couple of the par 5s on the course) this hole is long and difficult.


By the time I did finally reach the green, I had one of the more fun putts of the day that was a double breaker downhill from the front of the green.  Luckily it was one of the better putts of the day and allowed me to save my triple.

A note about the greens – personally I didn’t find them to be as difficult as I was expecting.  I thought the greens on the River Course at Blackwolf and even on our prior days round at Forest Dunes were a little bit tougher.

Looking back though I think that was a bit of a facade.  I just was finally putting halfway decent at Oakland Hills. Dan had at least one 4 putt and a bevy of 3 putts, and he said of all the courses he played in Michigan, that OHCC by far had the most diabolical greens.

Hole 15 (Par 4, 370 yards)

While still a dogleg left, this is another fun one.  With three giant bunkers right in the middle of the green you have to be smart off the tee. Best placement is left of the bunkers without being in the trees.

This gives you a manageable approach shot to the uphill green.

Oakland Hills Country Club is one of the Top 100 Golf Courses in the US
No big deal, just a trio of bunkers right in your landing area 🙂

Hole 16 (Par 4, 377 yards)

The signature hole on the course, and a daunting one from the tee. You need to get your ball far enough out to have a good play at the green, but even a moderate slice will leave you wet.

The approach isn’t any easier as the water wraps farther around the back than you think, and well, there are bunkers everywhere else.

Oakland Hills Country Club is one of the Top 100 Golf Courses in the US

Hole 17 (Par 3, 176 yards)

The last par 3 and arguably the most difficult.  Playing 185 and very uphill, it’s another case of “if you aren’t on the green, you probably won’t be happy.”


 


In my case I was the only one to land on the green, and I still wasn’t very happy as I found this to be one of the most difficult greens on the course.

Oakland Hills Country Club is one of the Top 100 Golf Courses in the US

Hole 18 (Par 5, 467 yards)

We end with a solid chance at birdie on this short par 5. Downhill off the tee and then back up on the approach, the 18th green nestled at the base of the clubhouse is quite a sight and a somewhat sad one at that, as it meant our round, and effectively the trip had come to a close.

One of those rounds you simply don’t want to end..
The member who took us out, Denton, told me on the 14th that we had to stay for lunch to try their home brewed IPA.  Being from the Northwest and a bit of a beer snob, there’s no way I could say no to that.  What I wasn’t expecting was the choice between their typical IPA and one aged in Woodford Reserve bourbon barrels – this became a no brainer.

Bourbon aged beers are some of my favorite, and this was easily one of the best I’d had. A totally unexpected surprise to see at a historical golf club near Detroit. I would have had 3 of them had I not had to immediately drive 5 and a half hours to Milwaukee to catch my flight to San Francisco.

Overall I actually enjoyed my round at Oakland Hills even more than I expected to. Although we played the front 9 at a fairly breakneck pace, and it wasn’t the most beautiful of weather days, the course was a lot of fun.  It rewarded you for hitting good shots, and when you did hit those good shots, it truly felt like an accomplishment.

It’s not hard to see why this course has so much history, and I just hope that one day I’ll be able to make it back and try and bring the “Monster” to it’s knees once again."

There are these nodal high points about the course I swear reincarnated my golfing soul throughout the day. There’s the clubhouse, which looks down upon the front nine in its valley. We sat in it and watched the storm come in, darkness descending mid morning and relentless with its shreds of water. Many left certain the day was lost but for some reason, I was never worried. It would pass. And so it did. Then there’s the hilltop of the Seventeenth green and Eighteenth tee. I felt a resurgence and the game seemed so easy and full of life. Sign me up for a couple rounds more. And the higher up greens, where the lines seem to call to me as a friend. The sun and countryside and splendid summer solitude were at their height. It seemed the closer I got to the sun, the more I felt in tune with the game.
My friends, the height of summer was upon us and I was right where I needed to be.
There are three, maybe four courses I yearn to visit and they’re not likely the ones you may think. I would choose these course over many others, even some many would think I’m insane for passing up. But I have my reasons and am confident that those I have in mind are rich and enlightening in experience. Crystal Downs was one of these. There are very few courses where Mackenzie and Maxwell designed together, with Maxwell also crafting the greens but they are among the best American golf masterpieces one can take in. Among those, there are even fewer that have been left relatively preserved through the decades. In fact, Crystal Downs may be the only one in such a preserved condition, as there are only two others I can think of that have not fared so well. JC Melrose in Philadelphia fell victim to a road being constructed through it and while it’s still around and has some great features, the road has taken its toll. The other is Augusta National.
Both of these designers are among my favorite and their separate designs are likewise remarkable. Yet there is something I feel is extraordinary when they teamed up. It is rare when two colossal talents in one field or another decide to collaborate and they find a way to elevate their craft. Mackenzie and Maxwell found a way and Crystal Downs is one of those rare instances where a symphony of talent and wonderful natural setting orchestrated together for absolutely sublime golf.
Perhaps those nodal points reached out to them as well.
Starting as a nine hole course in 1927, Mackenzie and Maxwell were persuaded to come examine the site as Mackenzie was on his way back to England after finishing Cypress Point to transform it into an eighteen hole course. Upon seeing the land, the trip to England was delayed while they worked on the design and routing. Maxwell returned the next summer and headed up construction, which included the greens. He continued to return each summer in that capacity until the course was completed in 1933. The club and course remained essentially as designed for the ensuing decades. Content to remain a quiet, relaxing club for its small membership that resided nearby, Ben Crenshaw visited in the mid 1980’s, which is also around the time Tom Doak moved to the area. Doak has worked on some of the greens (Second, Eleventh, Thirteenth and Fourteenth) and there has been some tree work but the course remains very much as it was when Maxwell looked upon it that summer of 1933. That is an extreme rarity nowadays, a welcome one indeed.
The front nine is situated in a valley of sorts, all of which can be seen from the clubhouse. Exposed to the elements, its low profile with extraordinary fairway contours as the routing moves about the valley and makes use of a prominent ridge before climbing back up the hill to the clubhouse. The routing ensures each hole is distinct from the other and not just distinct but pleasantly memorable. The greens, however, the greens are among the best I have played, elevating things from memorable to immortal. Movement that is true and balanced while visuals playfully deceive, all without over doing it. The front has a heathland feel to it while the playing structure is almost four dimensional, as the holes can be played from almost any angle and the lack of unplayable terrain between the holes adds to this. The back nine is mostly an out and back affair, moving to the higher meadows. Parkland elements introduce themselves yet the wide, rise, fall and twisting of the fairways maintains similar elasticity as the front. The variety remains with its sequencing and the closing duo crescendos in drama by using one of the more severe ridges for the Seventeenth green and Eighteenth tee. The round finishes at the base of the hill upon which the clubhouses sit, which await as you make one final climb, the reward of the splendid lake views there, always.
The course is rich with romantic character. The golfer continuously comes across inspirational views and shots, then walks on to greens that are even more so. Yes there is challenge and strategy and excitement yet there’s this romanticism that pervades and makes the round exceptionally transcendent. I felt that it was how the beautiful forested setting and distinctive hills frolic with the craftsmanship of the design in the best symbiosis possible, so that one enhances the other and leaves us with one of the more treasured cathedrals of our game.
The plan was for 36 holes. Not even a rather large morning storm was enough to deter those plans, which then turned into playing a nine hole course with an 8:50 p.m. tee time. You have to love those long Summer days. After the storm, the sun came out with resurgence and the course drained almost instantaneously. Summer grace in spades.
The First is a 460 yard par 4 (from the Blues). The course is before you and we are to enter into it, head first, to the fairway below. The fairway rises, so the approach will likely be substantial no matter how sound the tee shot is, which the wind will likely batter around anyways. They say here that missing left is a bogey while missing right is a disaster, but I’m not sure they have a saying for the golfer who misses right, then left. Well, the 25 foot one putt helped shore that up, surely inspired from the outstanding green that sits above the fairway. It is deep and falls off on the left, running back to front and right to left in general. A remarkable opener. Golf Magazine has it as one of the best par 4’s in the world. No disagreements here.

The First

Looking back
The Second is a 425 yard par 4. We turn around but remain on lower ground than the First for the most part. Usually downwind yet a bit uphill, there are large yet shallow bunkers on either side the tee show must contend with. This bunker configuration is similar at the green, guarding each side at the front. The green moves back to front and has no hesitation with seeing your ball roll off its sides, particularly the front, so deftness with the putter is advisable.

The Second

The Third is a 191 yard par 3. Even with the trees in the background, we begin to realize just how much wind factors in with every shot. That backdrop actually gives the wind something to bounce off of, which leaves our tee shots in fits. There’s a merciful apron short of the green for those that can live with themselves for wimping out while the green runs at an angle some what perpendicular to the tee. The recovery shots were what amazed me, as the range of possibilities and situations seem to be endless. The green moves off of the hill on which it sits.

The Fourth is a 409 yard par 4. A dog leg right for the most part where the tee shot runs the risk of running through the fairway on the left side, so your can put some left to right movement on it or take on the bunker on the right. I actually prefer the latter as a tee shot landing high right will then fall left, all while getting closer to the hole. One must take a moment in this fairway to admire the swales and ripples that stretch to the green. It’s one of the memories that I come back to often when I think of this place, envisioning the ball bouncing along about it after that tee shot, then again and perhaps again as the golfer makes his way to the green. The green sits slightly above and with the hillside of the fairway, the right side is subject to the ground game while the left side is more raised and a pitch is more likely in order. The green has some delightful interior undulations while the overall right to left pull is likely in every roll.

The Fifth is a 353 yard par 4. Looking back on it, it was so fitting that the storm rolled in as we played this hole. Yet another that Golf Magazine regards as one of the best par 4’s in the world, the tee shot should leave little doubt of this. A ridge is before us with bunkers about its face (the trio of them in the center are known as the, “Three Sisters”) and our charge is to carry it, some where. That some where is up to the golfer, with the caveat being the more left you go, the longer your tee shot must be to clear the ridge and shorter your approach. We hit our tee shots and walked up to the ridge when the siren to come in sounded. The thunder ominously rumbling above, we were able to examine the green in the distance before we were saved with a couple carts picking us up. As we walked in to the clubhouse and I looked out the window, the course disappeared in darkness and moments later, the throngs of water and roars and flashes of light put on a furious display.
It was as if it never happened as I stood over my approach shot a couple hours later, my ball exactly where I left it. The ridge falls left to right so hides a little bit of the green on the left side because of that, yet this gives us a cue as to where to favor the approach and the direction within which to expect the ball to move upon landing. Indeed, there are bunkers off to the right to collect those that don’t mind that left to right movement. Another long putt made here. I was in tune with the greens, my golf psyche intuitively appreciating the craft it had the fortune of experiencing.

The Sixth is a 382 yard par 4. The ridge is used again for the tee shot here and like the hole prior, decisions must be made. Carrying the ridge means a nice short approach in yet the more adventurous among us may opt for the right side line, which confronts a steeper side of the ridge and requires a longer carry. Bunkers on the ridge face here should give everyone pause, as the “Scabs” will likely lead to a lost stroke unless the golfer receives a fortunate lie and can pull off the shot. The green is the largest on the course, moves right to left and is free of greenside bunkers.

The Seventh is a 335 yard par 4. We have been essentially switching back and forth in this valley but this only shows that switchbacks are not created equal and some times, yield the best holes. The prominent land features are used creatively yet a number of times, ensuring that the unique land gives its best. Here, we tee off at the end of the ridge ahead, which drops down to the lowest grounds of the course. The base of where the ridge and these hills meets formed a natural bowl of sorts, which made for a truly remarkable green site. The tee shot does not need to be driver but may result in a blind approach if not far enough out. Indeed, the view of the green depends on the position of the tee shot while a tree on the right adds to this visual equation. There is some rough before the green on the lower ground, so that the approach must come in high. The green boomerangs around the end of the ridge, which bowls at either end. Bowls at either end. Unbelievable. Leave me here with a putter and wedge and a couple balls for eternity.

The Eighth is a 550 yard par 5. It is time to make our way back up to the heights of the clubhouse and what better way to do so than with what has been regarded as one of the best par 5’s in the world by Golf Magazine, and me. It all starts with a blind tee shot over a rise of jagged undulations. This is just a preview of the fairway contours, which are some of the best one can lay their eyes on. The tee shot is subject to their inherent randomness, as is the second shot. Only pure experience can start to figure out the best areas and lines here but the goal is to climb the hill. The green is above and smaller than one hopes, so approaches in must be exact and account for the whims of the hillside. The hole can be played countless ways and presents a myriad of characteristics in full. The challenge of the lies and hill, the strategy of placement and using the terrain to one’s advantage, the drama and inspiration of its heights; the crescendo of the front nine is before us and it is legendary.

The Ninth is a 175 yard par 3. An uphill tee shot with the clubhouse looking on. The green actually moves from front to back, so a tee shot getting up the hill only finishes half the battle; it must do so without enough on it to send it off the back. The bunkers on the right are no where anyone wants to be, as the hillside looms and could send the ball back down the cliffside. Likewise, this is one of those greens where care with the putter is a good idea, as overly aggressive putts could go back down into the valley with ease.

The Ninth

Looking back to that valley

The front nine moves about the valley exceptionally well and yields nine all world holes without a weak one in the bunch. I would rank them 4, 7, 6, 5, 1, 8, 3, 2, 9.
We arrive at the steps of the lower clubhouse. The views are unavoidable as we pause a few moments, then we descend back into the valley.


The back nine starts with the 395 yard par 4 Tenth. The tee shot drops down to the fairway and is generally inviting but it’s the approach we should focus on. The green is above and moves from left to right, back to front, fairly deliriously. The left side of the green is the mark, near the bunker on that side. The right side and front are liable to get slippery about the edges.

The Tenth

View of the green from the Eighteenth tee
The Eleventh is a 196 yard par 3. The back to front movement of the green and its tiered nature can cause absolute terror, especially for those shots ending up above the hole. The bunkers above the hole follow this theme and the fact I was able to get out of one of them staying on the green and not going all the way down the hill was probably one of the better shots/luckier breaks I had all day.

The Eleventh
The Twelfth is a 430 yard par 4. The longest green to tee walk is here, where we climb up the rest of the hill and the trees clear to the meadows that comprise most of the back nine. The fairway dog legs to the right off the tee and there used to be a Beech tree that was an aiming point but it is now gone. The trees on the right must be cleared for a look at the green on approach while the fairway runs right into the green, bunkers on either side and below grade. It’s a deceptively tough green to handle on the approach despite the room short and front. It’s a combination of the angle in and the direction the green runs as far as I can tell.

The Twelfth

Looking back
The Thirteenth is a 484 yard par 4. A similar left to right tee shot is ideal here to get around the trees and move the ball ever so closer to the green with the left to right cant of the fairway. Every yard matters, as the approach is one of the more challenging of the round. The green is tucked away at the far edge of a hill, with significant dip short of it and a bunker hiding on the high left side. Pin position determines the dynamics of the approach, with rear pins needing a hearty shot to that back side or a more surgical strike around the center that will fall correctly down to the rear half. Front pins will need to confront the left to right tilt on approach and with the flat stick, making it a bit tougher because of the movement. It’s a hell of a par 4 coming at the right time.

The Fourteenth is a 147 yard par 3. An uphill green with native grass between tee and green. There are seven bunkers lurking around the green, many of which cannot be seen from the tee. The rear ones and the sides above the pin bring the most concern, as the back to front movement can get complicated quickly.

The Fourteenth

The green, from the left

The Fifteenth is a 327 yard par 4. We turn around for home at this point. The green prior gives glimpses of just how close we are to Lake Michigan, albeit high above. The course is situated on a narrower isthmus between Lake Michigan and Crystal Lake. The wooded terrain shrouds views of the water in most areas but every now then, especially when the wind is up, there are brief windows of just how resplendent the longer views of the area are.
As for the hole, the tee shot must carry native foliage as the fairway bends to the left a little. A bounding tee shot is very helpful and those that reach the swale can have to roll to the other side ideally, yielding a much shorter approach. The shorter the approach, the better, as the green is diabolical, moving right to left and generally doesn’t like golf balls on it. The bunker positioning keeps in this theme of diabolism, one at the lower left and the other high right and actually, the entire high side. Make the shot to this green a good one.

The Sixteenth is a 588 yard par 5. Long and a bend left, this hole takes us the rest of the way through the high meadows. The fairway is a bit narrower than we’ve grown accustomed and aside from the tree line on the right and native grass on the left, our charge here is to bellow the ball a long ways. It is not until we reach the green that the bunkers start, encasing the green that sits a little below the fairway. The green is on the smaller side and more deep than wide, falling back to front and left to right.

The Sixteenth

Looking back
The Seventeenth is a 311 yard par 4. Transitioning from the high meadows into the hills, the closing duo is an impressive crescendo. The tee shot must be pondered. It will be to a right to left moving fairway that climbs abruptly to the green. The widest area seems to be at the start of the fairway, which leaves a longer approach but the green should be visible. A favorable wind could bring the green into play off the tee for some while others opting for a longer tee shot will likely have a blind short shot to the green. As for the green, it is deep yet narrow and no one would call it all that big. It falls off the sides into bunkers and the front, down the hill and likely further away than your approach. It’s a hole full of thrill and excitement, as well as strategy and grace under pressure. A great short par 4.

The Eighteenth is a 400 yard par 4. The fairway wraps around the hills to the right while the tee shot is elevated. One can see the clubhouse on top of another hill in line with the tee. The tee shot brings a lot of temptation to try and cut the fairway but the hillside is a lot larger than it looks so avoid the tempts. The fairway below moves uphill to the green, a gathering of bunkers guarding it all over. There’s also a lot of right to left movement that demands attention on approach. Learning my lesson from the first round, I gave it that attention and was able to close my time here with a par.
The ladies had just finished one of their tournaments and were making their way to the upper clubhouse. Music faintly reached us down the hill into the valley. The upper clubhouse yields the best views of the lakes and despite the spirited revelry, those views still imparted a good sense of calm. It seemed to be yet another nodal high point and as we lingered and finally came back down to the lower clubhouse, I realized the height of the summer came both figuratively and literally. The far side of the season was now upon us. The music plays on.

The back nine uses higher reaches of the property and continues with yet another series of outstanding par 4’s while the others are not far behind, all of it leading to a dramatic finish. I would rank them 17, 13, 15, 18, 10, 12, 11, 14, 16.
Generally, Crystal Downs is a wonderful golf course. It strikes a remarkable balance between its strategic, varied playing structure and beautiful setting, which evokes a pleasantly engaging experience. The fairways are its foundation with their contours and cants, which lead to infinitely interesting greens that have a spiritual fulfillment all their own. Its challenge is all encompassing but is presented so exquisitely that there is never any consternation, even when ensnared in some of its tougher chapters. This is largely due to its hazard placement and type, which always provides alternative avenues of recovery and those areas where there is no chance, the golfer intuitively understands his shot had no earthly reason for going near there in the first place and is fine accepting the consequence. It’s a splendid display of our game and the members have done well to preserve it in such a touching, simplistic manner that is rare to come across nowadays.
I only hope it stays as I left it for ages to come.
Clubhouse/Pro Shop: The lower clubhouse houses the pro shop and is for more casual lunches and gatherings while the upper clubhouse is reserved for more formal occasions. Both show off the surrounding beauty upon which you happen to find yourself.

The challenge on and around the greens creates the most demanding 6500 yards I've ever encountered, especially since the driving corridors are relatively generous. Nearby Arcadia Bluffs has more ""wow factor"" due to dramatic features and stunning Lake Michigan views, but Crystal Downs is a more elegant brilliance on a beautiful piece of property.

What to Expect:  Special. That is the first word that comes to mind when I reflect on Crystal Downs. Everything about Crystal Downs is special to the golfer that has developed a palate for the subtleties found in masterful architecture; architecture that challenges the mind as much as the body. Players are taken on a roller coaster of emotions as they traverse in and out of holes that range from being relatively easy to diabolically difficult to flat out brilliant. I've never played a course that I wanted to replay immediately afterwards as much as Crystal Downs. The subtleties in the design just beg you to come back and challenge again to see if you can play better the second time around. The course is short enough that you think you should be able to take advantage of it, but in the same vein as Merion, Crystal Downs demands respect and wisdom in every shot to avoid being punished more harshly than you would imagine. The speed and slope of the greens command absolute precision and will quickly expose any shortcomings you have with your putter or wedges; more so than any other course I've seen. From the pro shop and first tee you have a view of the entire front nine coupled with views of Crystal Lake; it is truly one of the most impressive panoramas in all of golf. On the back nine you are afforded glimpses of Lake Michigan and I was surprised there weren't more views of it, but the course is so good on its own that the backdrops suddenly don't matter that much. Holes 5-9 can only be rivaled by Pebble Beach as one of my all time favorite front nine stretches in golf, #13 is one of the finest and most demanding two-shotters I've had the privilege of playing, and #17 launched itself to the top of my favorite driveable par 4s. The first time around the course there might be a couple of holes that don't wow you or perhaps are drowned out due to how phenomenal other holes on the property are, but I think you'll find greater appreciation for those understated holes in subsequent loops around Crystal Downs. The course is a challenging walk given how hilly the terrain is and caddies are available through the main season though many players will elect to ride a cart. Crystal Downs may rivals Cypress Point as having the most understated pro shop and general amenities in contrast to how incredible the golf is; something I really love because it shows how the club is simply all about golf. It has nothing to do with the course itself, but it should be noted that the staff and membership are perhaps the most down to earth people I've come across at a Top 20 course and appreciate visitors who know and understand golf course architecture and the brilliance that is Crystal Downs.

Individual Hole Analysis
Signature Hole:  17th Hole – 311 Yard Par 4 – Crystal Downs lays claim to a handful of the finest golf holes on the planet and this is certainly one of them. The 17th at Crystal Downs is the most treacherous driveable par four you are likely to ever face. When the wind is in your face tunnelled through the trees the green becomes unreachable and players have to figure out a safe place to hit their tee ball. The fairway tilts severely from right to left and features limited good options. A tee shot that doesn't carry 180 yards will require hacking out of the junk into the fairway and effectively eliminating any birdie chance. A 200 yard tee shot will feed into a popular bowl to hit from although the angle leaves a limited view of the green. Tee shots that go deep up the left side are dead while a 250 - 280 drive towards the right greenside bunker will leave the ideal spot to hit from. 311 yards may look like a pushover on the scorecard but I have no doubt that this hole plays over par every single day of the year.

17th Hole at Crystal Downs Country Club (311 Yard Par 4)
Best Par 3:  9th Hole – 175 Yards – Another brilliantly difficult hole that just doesn't seem that intimidating from the tee. While the uphill nature of the tee shot may get into some golfer's heads, it is everything around the green that should be kicking the fear in. The safe play is short right, but not so short that your ball feeds right back down the fairway. Carrying it to long on the right side and finding the bunker will result in one of the most difficult sand saves of your life given how nasty the green is at feeding balls away from the hole and back to the front edge of the green or off altogether. Anything left of the green is an instant double bogey . . . at best.

9th Hole at Crystal Downs Country Club (175 Yard Par 3)
Best Par 4:  5th Hole – 353 Yards – Perhaps Crystal Downs' most acclaimed hole, the 5th is a wonderful example of not needing a ton of length to have a strategic hole with sufficient difficulty. The brilliance in any design incorporates viable options throughout rather than demanding specific shots all day long. On the 5th hole multiple options are presented off the tee since a trio of bunkers part the hogback fairway. The safest tee shot is left of the bunker but sets up a blind approach shot to a green that slopes away from the player. Hitting right of the bunkers sets up a much better angle to the green but brings a large tree into play and long ballers may have their tee shot scoot into trouble since a view of the right side of the hogback fairway is not offered. Some players may elect to stay short of the bunker trio while other may want to test their merits at carrying the spacious bunker in the waste area with a power fade that can feed the ball up near the green. The theme of difficult greens is back in full force on the 5th hole which features a severely sloped back-to-front and left-to-right surface that often feeds balls to the grass edge between the green and bunkers. Holes like this make Crystal Downs and Merion the most well designed and difficult ""short"" courses in the country.

5th Hole at Crystal Downs Country Club (353 Yard Par 4)
Best Par 5:  8th Hole – 550 Yards – Another great hole and one of the most revered par fives in world. In a day and age where architects often feel they need to laden a hole with an undue amount of bunkering or hazards, Dr. MacKenzie lets Mother Earth be the star here by draping this three-shotter over a very undulated fairway that climbs uphill the whole way home. 550 yards may seem reachable for some players, but the significant uphill climb eliminates that thought for most players as they just try to figure out a good spot to hit their third shot from to attack the green. There are so many undulations throughout the wide fairway that it is useless to focus on any one particular location as a lay up zone, but I will recommend that you lay up closer to the green than your traditional ""favorite yardage"" since the uphill nature of the approach shot will add a full club to reach the small green. Perfect golf is required to birdie this hole; near perfect golf is needed for a par.

8th Hole at Crystal Downs Country Club (550 Yard Par 5)
Birdie Time:  7th Hole – 335 Yard Par 4 – How could anyone ever tire of playing Crystal Downs? It is a living masterpiece and the 7th hole features on of the most unforgettable greens you'll ever play. The tee shot plays to a fairway that runs out of room about 225 yards from the tee. Most players will play short of that drop off and allow themselves a clean view of the boomerang green that lies in wait. Bolder players may elect to hit their tee shot into the swell beyond the end of the fairway and leave themselves with a shorter, but blind approach to the green. The boomerang shaped green wraps around a hill which also features a pair of sloping bunkers. If you can't have fun putting on this green to the various pin locations then you need to pick up backgammon or something because this green is a blast!

7th Hole at Crystal Downs Country Club (335 Yard Par 4)
Bogey Beware:  13th Hole – 442 Yard Par 4 – Writing this review reminds me of just how good Crystal Downs is. Each time I get to a hole to write commentary on I think, ""Oh yeah, that really was an awesome hole!"" The 13th is one of my all time favorite par fours which is saying alot considering my favorite two-shotters are generally oceanside like Pebble Beach's 8th, Cypress Point's 17th, and Maidstone's 9th.. This dogleg right calls for a fade off the tee that falls on the right half of the fairway while avoiding the forest and bunker right of the rough. A shot that comes to rest short of the right fairway bunker will be greeted by a looming tree that will block, or at a minimum alter, your approach shot into the green. Approaching this green from the left is instant death as the vast majority of balls will end up tumbling into the right greenside bunker. To say that the front-to-back and left-to-right tilt of the green is severe would be an understatement considering some might even contend it isn't fair, but that is some of the beauty of this hole. The middle of the green is divided by a ridge that causes more havoc in a green than any other I can recall. If your ball is resting on the opposite side of the ridge from the hole your chances of two-putting are quite low considering how difficult it is to even keep the ball on the green while crossing the ridge. To tame this beast with a four or better may be the most rewarding experience on the course considering it is easily the toughest par on the course. If someone told me there were more snowman scores on this hole than pars I would believe it."
41,Seminole,top100,"Juno Beach, FL",Donald Ross,1929,Seminole Golf Club,Cal Simmons,rev041_seminole_1,"For someone that gets to Florida once a decade, playing all the great courses in the state is difficult. Particularly so when the courses are in remote areas of this large state. Seminole is on the ocean in the far southeast part. I had come to peace with the fact that I would never play what many call Donald Ross’s finest work, Seminole. Then the invitation from a friend came in. 

“We will meet Tuesday at 12:30 for lunch, play 18 in the afternoon, 36 on Wednesday and 18 on Thursday,” he said. A dream trip. It seems that after playing a great course you want another crack at it. I would have four chances to figure out how to play this gem.

I make my way down the long narrow road that also serves as access for an adjacent residential area. Ten foot high oleanders keep the course hidden from the outside world. I creep around the corner into the gravel parking lot. 

There is nothing ostentatious about Seminole. Gravel parking lot, modest clubhouse, no attendants swarming those arriving. I change shoes in the parking lot, give my clubs to the only outside services person and head to the patio for lunch. 

Once a club not welcoming to the outside world, the attitude has changed. With the televised skins game featuring PGA Tour players during the pandemic, and hosting the Walker Cup Match on May 8th and 9th, 2021, the world finally will see this fabulous course.

After a brief warm up I stand on the first tee. I am struck by how flat the course is. There are a few palm trees and no punitive rough. Sandy waste areas appear to outline many of the fairways. Bunkers define the flow of the holes. 

The course is minimalist to an extreme. Other than tee markers, flagsticks and rakes there is nothing else on the course. There are no benches, ball washers, directional markers, above ground waste cans, rest rooms. There is one spot for water on each nine, well out of play and partially hidden in the bushes. It’s a clean look that is refreshing. 

The only refreshment stand is after hole nine, located on the lower level of the clubhouse.

While the first hole appears benign, we learn quickly that this course is going to be about iron shots into the greens, being on the correct side of the hole and judging distance control. 

“By the time we finish four rounds you will appreciate the precision required on each hole,” my host says to me. How prophetic that was.

Rumor has it that during a regrassing project over 50 years ago many of the humps, bumps and rolls disappeared. However, what remains are 18 of the most demanding green complexes I have seen. A ball hit to the wrong side of the hole location can trickle off into a bunker or 50 yards down a slope into a waste area. 

Often a drive to the wrong side of the fairway will leave a shot requiring such distance control and accuracy that even the finest players are challenged. 

Local knowledge is important. Knowing where the deep section of the green is or where not to have the ball land can mean the difference between par and double bogey. The superior caddies take care of the knowledge component. 

The sand based greens are firm and fast, maybe the fastest I have ever played. 

A forty foot high sand dune runs along the far side of the course. Another is along the ocean side. Ross uses the dunes brilliantly. What appears from the first tee to be a flat course with little interesting topography is anything but. 

Thirteen holes use the dunes. While the sandy waste areas in the flat are firm sand, off the fairway the dunes sand is sink your feet in soft. This leaves a wayward shot into the dunes sand all but unplayable, plugged after missing the fairway. 

The holes that do not use the dunes have challenging green complexes with false fronts, tight bunkering and greens sloping in all directions. 

Water flows in and out of ponds in the middle of the property. With firm fairways and little rough a ball heading toward the water will not stop, no matter how much pleading the player exerts. 

Holes run in every direction. No back and forth here. This generates interesting challenges because the wind blows nearly constantly and from day to day in every direction.

Famously, Ben Hogan would spend time at Seminole preparing for the Masters. Just like Augusta National, Seminole demands strategic positioning off the tee with accurate iron shots to the greens. 

Rumor has it that his favorite hole was the sixth, an uphill par four to a well bunkered green running diagonally away from the player. The green is somewhat remindful of the 12th at Augusta, with the carry required to the right portion of the green longer than the left. 

Tipping out at 7320, the challenge for all players is to hit the ball high enough to hold the firm, fast, elevated greens, while controlling the distance to the correct position on the green. 

Modern architecture features wide fairways. Players want to find their ball. However, the great courses have always had wide fairways. Augusta National, Pine Valley, Sand Hills, to name a few. The fairways are generous at Seminole. 

Starting at the second hole the course moves up and around the major sand dune on the course. The holes are challenging, bunkers deep and the greens severe. The teeth of the course are the holes on and around the dunes. 

Ross gives the player a breather on the flat holes 8-10, until going back up the dune at numbers 11 thru 14. The course finishes with the challenging 16th green, terrific short down hill par three 17th and fun shortish par 4, 18th. 

Not that the breather holes are easy. An errant shot to a green can quickly turn into a double bogey or worse. 

One of the most difficult holes to build is a great uphill par three. Having a green with character visible from the tee, along with creative bunkering, is rarely seen. 

The 13th is just such a par 3. Another green that diagonally moves away from the player, two large bunkers ominously await the errant shot that hangs to the right. 

Not to be missed at Seminole is the locker room. It’s as large an open locker room as I have ever seen. Jack Burke and Jimmy Demerit patterned some aspects of the locker room at Champions Golf Club in Houston after Seminole, as have other clubs. 

With ceilings 25’ high or higher, the winners of the club tournaments are painted on the large wooden plaques around the room. It is a room filled with character and history. The floor creeks under the carpet as I walk, gazing up at the names on the wall. 

Nearly 100 years old, it has wooden lockers around the perimeter, with a large comfortable seating area in the middle. I think about the great players listed on the walls above, walking the same floors.

Another highlight of Seminole is the golf staff, headed by the dean of PGA Professionals in the US.  Bob Ford has trained and had many of his assistants be selected to be head professionals at some of the finest courses in the country. The sincere attitude and level of service provided adds to the enjoyment of a day at Seminole. 

It was a thrill to see and play Seminole. I owe my host a big debt of gratitude for inviting me. I would love to go back again. While we caught two great days with little wind in the morning, typically it blows around 20 mph or stronger. 

“I couldn’t keep my hat on my head the last time I was here,” said my friend. The wind, the firm and lightning fast green complexes make Seminole what it is, a great course that is difficult. 

It was a special trip to see Seminole. I would love to go back again in A Life In Golf. "
42,Seminole,top100,"Juno Beach, FL",Donald Ross,1929,Ari’s Course Reviews: Seminole Golf Club,Ari Techner,rev042_seminole_2,"Like all of us, I am excited for the return of golf to TV on Sunday as DJ, Rory, Rickie, and Matt Wolff tee it up at Seminole for a charity match. Seminole is a very special place and one that most don’t get a chance to see, so it’s very exciting that they have opened their doors for this match and allowed the whole world to watch.

Seminole Golf Club opened in 1929 and was designed by Donald Ross. The course is consistently ranked as the best course in Florida and one of the best in the country. It is generally considered to be Ross’ best course along with Pinehurst No. 2.

The course is situated on a squarish 140-acre piece of land that sits in between Ocean Ave. on the west and the Atlantic Ocean on the east. There are two large north-south running dune ridges—a 40-foot dune to the west side of the property and a smaller dune on the east edge along the ocean—that define the property. Ross uses these dunes to great effect in shaping the holes. In fact, 13 of 18 holes are directly influenced by these dunes.

The lower elevation parts of the property are actually below sea level and feature a few drainage ponds and canals to shuttle water away from the turf. The routing is quite exceptional in its variety and uses every inch of this small property to its advantage. Each hole runs a slightly different direction which makes it difficult on this very windy site to always determine the exact direction of the wind.

A recent restoration by Bill Coore and Ben Crenshaw has returned the bunkering to its original Ross glory as well as opened up old sandy waste areas on the dunes that had been lost to time. The course was also worked on in the mid-late 1940s by Dick Wilson, who brought the course back after WW2. Despite being worked on by these other architects, Seminole is considered very true to its original Donald Ross design and one of the most authentic Ross courses left in the country.

The course is famously difficult despite its moderately short length, though new back tees now stretch it to over 7,300 yards. The main defense of the course is its small, contoured greens and its many bunkers, often deep and treacherous, especially around the greens. Ben Hogan famously used to practice here to get ready for The Masters. Similar to Augusta, this is largely a second-shot golf course where positioning on the greens relative to the hole location is key for success.


Like a lot of older, classic courses, and typical of Ross, it’s always best to be below the hole and anyone who finds themselves past the hole or especially over the green are in for a very tough next shot or lag putt. This is made more difficult by the firm and fast greens that are hard to hold on all but the best-struck shots. It has a reasonable mix of shot requirements into the greens with many requiring an aerial shot and a few holes where you can use the typically firm turf to run the ball up onto the green.

The course is a real treat to play, especially if you like windy, firm, and fast golf.


Official Seminole scorecard. The pros will play from championship tees beyond the gold.

Seminole Golf Club: Hole by hole
The 1st hole is a mid-length par 4 that starts down in the low area by the clubhouse and is a gentle handshake of a start. The fairway is flat with bunkers staggered on both sides and the green tilts away from the line of play with bunkers left and right but open in the front.

The 2nd is a longer par 4 that gives you your first introduction to the dune ridge to the west. A new back tee makes the carry over the water about 240 yards. The fairway is flanked by bunkers and the first sandy waste area up on the left. The real fun is at the green, which is set up into the dune ridge, is surrounded by bunkers and is extremely difficult.

The 3rd is a dogleg-right par 5 that’s reachable for long hitters. The tee sits up on the dune ridge and the tee shot drops down back to the flat part of the property. The tee shot is over the sandy waste area and a set of bunkers set into the fairway. The green is set back on top of the dune and slopes hard back to front. I once watched a player who has won multiple amateur major championships hit this green in two and then putt off the green into the front bunker.

The 4th is a par 4 that plays along the top of the dune ridge to a fairway that serpents through fairway bunkers and sandy waste area set on both sides. The green is slightly elevated and slopes off on all sides.

The 5th is the first par 3. It is typically a mid-iron to a small, rounded green that is completely surrounded by six deep bunkers. Always a tough target to hit and hold.

The 6th is a hole that was singled out by Hogan as one of his favorites. A shorter par 4 of a little under 400 yards, the fairway is squeezed between the out of bounds property line of trees on the right and a sandy waste area on the left and is flanked by bunkers on both sides. A line of three bunkers coming off the right side of the green cut into the middle of the fairway short of the green to about 75 yards. The slightly uphill, hourglass-shaped green tilts to the left and away from the line of play and is very hard to judge and hold.


6th hole. VERY difficult up and down from that bunker. Will do well just to hold the green from there.

The 7th plays from an elevated tee on the dune ridge down to a flatter fairway flanked by bunkers on both sides. There’s water fronting the green which is also flanked on both sides by bunkers.

The 8th is a long par 3 that plays slightly uphill to a large green that is open in front allowing a run-up shot if hit towards the middle of the green. A longer shot to one of the bigger greens on the course. Four bunkers around the green catch any stray stray balls hit in their direction.

The 9th is a par 5 that is pretty straight playing along the boundary line of the property. There is a little water canal that creeps in on the left side and then pinches the fairway. There are bunkers on both sides staggered up the fairway from tee to green. The green itself is small, flanked by a single bunker on both sides, and extremely contoured, especially on the front—another hole where you can run the ball onto the green.

The 10th heads back away from the clubhouse and is back down on the lower, flatter land. A classic cape hole, there’s water left off the tee that also wraps around the front and left of the small, contoured green. It’s the third hole in a row where you can use the firm turf and contours to run the ball onto the green, though I doubt you will see anyone do that Sunday!

The 11th is a long, tough par 4. The tee shot is over a water hazard that also wraps around the right side of the fairway. The approach shot is uphill and partially blind to a narrow green surrounded by trouble. One of the harder holes on the course.


Heading up the hill towards the difficult 11th green.

The 12th is a very interesting, mid-length par 4. The tee shot is downhill off the dune ridge to a fairway with a little canal of water left and a couple of bunkers towards the end of the fairway to make the longer hitters think a bit. This green is just diabolical with a very narrow front section and six bunkers surrounding it. This is my personal favorite green on the course.


The diabolical 12th green. My favorite on the course.

The 13th is a fantastic par 3 that plays directly at the ocean. Another small target to hit especially with a lot of wind, the green tilts left to right and the green is surrounded by nine bunkers. The green sits on top of the eastern dune ridge and is set right at the edge of the beach. This is Seminole’s version of a reverse redan.


The reverse redan 13th. Hitting directly at the ocean and usually into a stiff breeze.

The 14th is the first of two par 5s in a row and is very reachable for the longer hitter. The fairway landing area is flanked by bunkers on both sides and there’s water left of the bunkers that rides the left side as well as another water hazard on the right near the landing area for many players layup shot. The green is small and surrounded by bunkers. It is set up back up on the dune ridge again.

The 15th is a hole that I really like. It is a mid-length par 5 with two different fairway options off the tee. The right fairway is more narrow, requires a longer carry over water and has a row of trees and bunkers on the left side. The water you have to carry off the tee also wraps around the right side of the fairway. Hitting it here makes the hole play shorter and provides a better, more open angle into the green for the player trying to reach in two. The left side is a much shorter carry over the water and has a little more room but provides a longer next shot with a worse angle. A very interesting and strategic hole that plays very different day to day based on different wind direction and intensity.

The 16th is mid-length, dogleg-right par 4 that plays to a fairway with a sharp right bend to it. The inside of the dogleg has five bunkers to catch the aggressive long hitter who takes the better line into the green. The green is again small and very hard to hold with 4 deep bunkers to penalize misses.


The approach shot into the 16th green. The first of a great stretch of 3 finishing holes.

The 17th is an all-world, short to mid-length par 3 where you are happy just to hit and hold the green. The tee is set next to the beach and offers one of the best views on the course. The green is extremely narrow and surrounded by seven deep bunkers that make par very difficult. The green is very hard to hold even with a short club in your hands. Par feels like an accomplishment on this one especially when the wind is up.


The 17th green. One of the hardest greens to hit in golf with a short to mid-iron in your hands.

The 18th tee also offers a great view of the ocean. The hole is a mid-length, dogleg-left par 4. The tee shot plays downhill to a fairway that slopes and bounces right and is once again flanked by bunkers on both sides. The approach shot is back uphill to a green sitting on the dune ridge that is surrounded by deep bunkers and generally slopes back to front and left to right. A great finishing hole.

A day playing golf at Seminole is not one to be missed. It’s one of the best golf experiences in the country and easily my favorite course in Florida. The facilities are top-notch and it has my favorite locker room in golf. The diagram of Claude Harmon’s course record round is one of the coolest things I’ve ever seen and it’s a testament to the course and its lasting challenge that his course record still stands.

I’ve been lucky enough to play the course a number of times over the years, and I can say that the work that Coore/Crenshaw and the club have done here is fantastic. The bunkers are much better than ever before and I absolutely love the look of the sandy waste areas that have been brought back as well as all the new, long views from up on the dune ridge where you can nearly see the whole course.

I am extremely excited to watch these four guys on Sunday take on this course in a way that most of us never could. I’m sure they will pull off some amazing shots and moments, but I’ll bet that Seminole proves once again it cannot simply be overpowered with length. Cheers to the club for opening their doors to all of us for this event, and let’s all enjoy golf being back on TV this Sunday!

43,The Country Club (Clyde/Squirrel),top100,"Brookline, MA",TCC Members/Willie Campbell,1899,The Country Club (Clyde & Squirrel),top100golfcourses,rev043_the_country_club_1,"The Country Club in Brookline played host to the 1999 Ryder Cup matches between the USA and Europe. Team Captains were Ben Crenshaw (US) and Mark James (Europe). For the third successive time, a single point decided the Ryder Cup, which was dubbed the “Battle of Brookline”. Europe hoped for a third successive win and required only four points from the 12 singles matches on Sunday, but the Americans rallied and easily won the first six matches to take the lead. Europe’s chances rested on Jose-Maria Olazabal, who was battling with Justin Leonard. On the 17th, Leonard holed an unlikely long birdie putt that resulted in a premature US Team celebration, which deeply upset the Europeans. Unfortunately Olazabal missed his shorter putt for a half on 17 but went on to a birdie the last to halve the match. USA 14 ½ - Europe 13 ½. The Ryder Cup was played at Valderrama in 1997 and at The Belfry in 2002.

The name may sound a little arrogant and for golfers in the know, there’s no need to explain that THE Country Club was the first of its type in the USA. It’s set in the charming heart of New England but to be precise it’s located in the suburbs of Brookline, Boston Massachusetts.

Apparently there was talk of forming The Country Club way back in 1860, but the Civil War (in part) interrupted proceedings – the club was eventually formed in 1882. Soon afterwards, golf arrived in the shape of a simple 6-hole layout, which was soon extended to 9 holes by Willie Campbell. In December 1894, the Country Club became one of the five founder members of the American Golf Association, which was subsequently renamed the United States Golf Association. The other four charter members were: Newport Country Club, Shinnecock Hills Golf Club, St. Andrew's Golf Club (Yonkers, N.Y.), and Chicago Golf Club.

By 1910, golf had caught on in the Boston area and the course was extended to a full 18 holes. Little did they know that three years later, a defining moment in American golf would take place in the shape of the 1913 US Open, which saw amateur Francis Ouimet – a young, unknown twenty-year-old and a former caddy at the Country Club – defeat the legendary professionals, Harry Vardon and Ted Ray in an exciting 18-hole play-off. Ouimet’s victory injected huge interest in golf in the United States and it gave hope to ordinary Americans by proving that normal people could achieve success alongside those who were more financially fortunate.

The 27 holes in play today at The Country Club were constructed at different times with input from numerous architects. Francis Ouimet won the US Open on the original course (Clyde & Squirrel), but the modern-day championship layout consists of fifteen holes of the original eighteen, with four holes from William Flynn's Primrose nine-hole loop (two Primrose holes are combined to make one tough and long tournament par four).

In 2009, Gil Hanse was entrusted to deliver a Master Plan for the restoration of all 27 holes."
44,The Country Club (Clyde/Squirrel),top100,"Brookline, MA",TCC Members/Willie Campbell,1899,"The Country Club (Brookline) (Chestnut Hill, Massachusetts)",Bill Satterfield,rev044_the_country_club_2,"Going into my round at Brookline, I was a bit fearful that The Country Club’s impressive rating in the Top 100 rankings was going to be a result of the history at the club rather than the design of the golf course. While I enjoy rich tradition at various clubs, I’m an architecture junky at heart and thus the quality of the property and individual hole designs is what really spins my wheels. Fortunately, my expectations were exceeded at Brookline where I discovered a course that had it all; a beautiful inland piece of property, incredible history/tradition, and memorable holes that were both enjoyable and challenging. The property consists of 27 holes with the Clyde and Squirrel 9s comprising the members’ 18 hole course and the Primrose 9 being utilized primarily by families and individuals looking for a more casual round. Part of the tradition at The Country Club is the mandatory walking policy on the Clyde/Squirrel course (unless you have medical condition) and being provided a caddie to carry your clubs and assist you throughout your round. The club has hosted 15 USGA events including three U.S. Opens and the 1999 Ryder Cup. When hosting these type of events, the club forgoes use of the 9th, 10th, and 12th holes of the Clyde/Squirrel course and fuses in the 1st hole (playing to the 2nd green), 8th hole, and 9th hole from the Primrose course. While the three holes left out of the Clyde/Squirrel course are solid, the holes brought in from the Primrose course are nothing short of spectacular. Recognized as the oldest country club in the country, Brookline is blessed with extensive facilities that include several indoor and outdoor tennis courts, squash courts, a skeet shooting area, skating/hockey facilities, and an Olympic-sized swimming pool. In fact, the club used to enjoy equestrian activities on the property and evidence of that land use is still visible on the holes near the clubhouse. The quality of the holes, the movement of the terrain, the bunkering and fescue use, and the rich history of the club was very reminiscent of Merion for me. In short, The Country Club is spectacular in every way and has instantly become one of my all time favorite courses.

Individual Hole Analysis
Signature Hole:  7th Hole – 197 Yard Par 3 – The 7th hole claims its status as the signature hole at The Country Club due to the quality of this one-shotter paired with the fact that it is the oldest hole on the property and the only hole remaining from the original six holes built in 1893. The raised green features a challenging double plateau and is protected by bunkers left and right. If you aren’t playing the tips, this is the first non-par four you’ll encounter at Brookline and definitely fits the adage of being an oldie but a goodie.

7th Hole at The Country Club (Brookline) (197 Yard Par 3)
7th Hole at The Country Club (Brookline) (197 Yard Par 3)
Best Par 3:  2nd Hole – 190 Yards – When you first look at the scorecard and see the tips measuring out 90 yards shorter than the women’s tee, you may assume there is a misprint. However, it is actually a unique situation where the championship course utilizes an alternative tee box on the right side of this par four and thus creates a par three for players teeing it up on the black tees. Although I am not certain, my assumption is that this par three was created in an effort to supplement the loss of the short 12th hole when it is abandoned (along with two other holes) in lieu of the lengthier holes from the Primrose course. If the 2nd hole played as a par four from the tips and the 12th hole were discarded for championship play, it would leave just two par threes on the course (the 7th and 16th) which would be a highly unusual routing and unbalanced test. The 2nd hole plays uphill to a green that is heavily bunkered on the left side. However a ball that goes left of the putting surface will hope to find the sand, because the gnarly, deep fescue rough surrounding the bunkers and green is nearly impossible to save par from; assuming you can even find your ball. I’m a big fan of slightly blind uphill par 3s due to the intrigue and anticipation of finding out where your ball is after you crest the hill and the 2nd hole at Brookline doesn’t disappoint.

2nd Hole at The Country Club (Brookline) (190 Yard Par 3)
Best Par 4:  3rd Hole – 451 Yards – My favorite hole at The Country Club was this unique two-shotter that features the best risk/reward opportunity on the property. This hour glass shaped hole encourages the safe player to play their tee shot up the left side of the fairway where it will tumble out of sight as it rolls down the hill and leaves a lengthy approach over a protruding bunker to a green lined with sand on both sides and a pond to the rear. The risky player will bomb their tee shot over the rocky hill on the right side of the hole which will effectively carry the bottle neck portion of the hole and propel the ball to the top of the hour glass fairway. Effectively pulling off this tee shot will open up the angle to the green and leave a short wedge shot into the putting surface. The blind nature of the tee shot puts additional pressure on the golfer to trust his swing and decision; any doubt in either of those elements can quickly lead to a big number on the scorecard. The fairway tumbles between hills on either side of the short grass thus creating deceptive visuals, intriguing playing options, and unique bounces. The feeling I had when I walked off the green was, “Man, I wish I could go play that hole again right now,” which is the sign of any great hole.

3rd Hole at The Country Club (Brookline) (451 Yard Par 4)
Best Par 5:  11th Hole – 513 Yards – Brookline features just two par fives, both of which are great and are found on the back nine. The reachable 11th is particularly enjoyable as it plays over a pond off the tee and calls for a drive that threads between the rock mound on the right and the tree line on the left. If you have been doing your P90X and feel like you can carry the rock formation on the right, you will definitely be in the go zone for reaching this green in two. A creek crosses the fairway and becomes a factor with a mammoth drive. The creek is also a factor following a short drive when the player must decide whether to try and carry the water or stay short of it in preparation of their third shot. The green sits on a hill that plays at least two clubs longer than the yardage to reach and features an attractive amphitheatre of trees surrounding the putting surface. The raised green is one of the finest locations on the property and view back down the hole offers an excellent visual of the features that make it one of the best holes in the Bay State.

11th Hole at The Country Club (Brookline) (513 Yard Par 5)
Birdie Time:  6th Hole – 334 Yard Par 4 – Standing on the 6th tee at The Country Club gave me a flashback to standing on the 10th tee at Merion. Both holes are uphill driveable par fours that call for a slight draw and can put a shot of momentum into your round. Nine bunkers are found on the hole with six of them being located at the end of the fairway and around the green. This grouping of bunkers, along with consideration of the wind, should dictate what club you take off the tee. The fairway narrows the closer it gets to the green thus putting a greater premium on accuracy the longer you try to hit the ball off the tee. Hitting anything less than driver will leave an uphill approach shot to a blind putting surface which is a combination that leave a golfer second guessing just how hard to hit his 2nd shot. All of that being said, short par fours are excellent opportunities to card birdies and this is no exception. So hit your tee shot down to your favorite yardage and then take dead aim for the flag.

6th Hole at The Country Club (Brookline) (334 Yard Par 4)
Bogey Beware:  5th Hole – 497 Yard Par 4 – The Country Club’s most difficult hole is also one of its finest. This nearly 500 yard beast features a blind tee shot where the optimal tee ball will travel over the hill on the right while staying inside the tree line. Open space is offered to the left off the tee but introduces a much longer approach shot on this dogleg right as well as introducing gnarly fescue grass. A pair of cross bunkers comes into play well short of the green while another pair of bunkers flank the left side of the green. The back-to-front, right-to-left sloping green generates difficult putts and brings bogey into play even after hitting the green in regulation. Every stroke on this hole is demanding and thus the perfect candidate for Bogey Beware.

Tillinghast,1918,A Walk into the Past: San Francisco GC,Phillip Johnson,rev045_san_francisco_1,"Golf, like most everything, has been revolutionized, dominated, and overrun by the emergence of technology. There are positives and negatives to the state of today’s game versus the game our grandfathers and their grandfathers played. Technological advancements in equipment have undeniably made the game easier and more enjoyable for most players. The ball flies longer and straighter, woods are larger yet lighter, and irons use perimeter weighting to ensure the toe-ball you just hit still carries the junk. At golf courses, technology has allowed conditioning to reach new levels. Golfers have grown to expect immaculate fairways and greens, and bunkers raked to perfection. Rangefinders give us the exact yardage, not only to the hole, but to lips of traps and branches of trees. In the same breath, technology has taken away from the experience of golf. Smartphones have made avoiding a phone call, text, email or tweet virtually impossible. When the pace of play is slow, it’s easy to open the social media of your choice and start scrolling. One way or another, we often rob ourselves of the full experience of golf.

Never before have I experienced pure golf as I did this fall at San Francisco Golf Club. It’s a true golf club; there is no pool, no tennis courts, and a strict no cell phone policy. It keeps the distractions away and the focus on golf. Entering SFGC feels like entering a time machine. The inconspicuous entrance leads through the trees to a small parking lot. The men’s locker room features a wood-burning fireplace that is aflame before 7 a.m. and original, wooden lockers from 1915. It feels as if A.W. Tillinghast himself could round the corner to greet you at any moment.

As you would guess, there are no carts available. Even further, caddies are mandatory. At SFGC, the game is meant to be played as it was in 1915. It means rangefinders are not allowed, and your caddie won’t have one either. If you think that’s tough, wait until you come to realize that there are no distance markers on the course – none at all. The caddies are familiar with the course and will eyeball the yardages for you and tell you how to play the shot (this gets more confusing if you haven’t dealt with the San Francisco marine layer, which makes the ball go considerably shorter). The caddies will tell you everything you are used to getting from your rangefinder. Are they as accurate? Of course not, but this is how the game was played when this iconic track was constructed, and the club has preserved the guesswork, feel, and player-caddie relationship that is now absent in other courses. Playing without exact yardages at a course you have never seen is significantly more difficult than I could have imagined. My playing partner, Ryan, and I estimated it was a full three shots more difficult, especially because SFGC happens to be very hilly. The elevation changes, coupled with the fact that it is a strategic masterpiece (meaning well-placed bunkers on the inside of doglegs, amongst other things), meant that we had to put serious thought into every shot. There were no easy decisions as every shot presented its unique risks and rewards based on your angle of entry. San Francisco GC isn’t insanely difficult (73.6/133 from 6,836 yards), yet I cannot remember playing a golf course that required more thought than this one. It rewards good strategy and execution and punishes the opposite. Is that not how golf is meant to be?

I could write thousands of words about the excellence of San Francisco Golf Club’s design. It was strategic, featured no weak holes, had immaculate conditioning and left nothing to be desired. The artistic bunkering looked like Tillinghast had Alister MacKenzie hanging over his shoulder during construction. Somehow none of these aspects were my most vivid takeaway from my visit. I learned, or perhaps relearned, what made me fall in love with the game of golf. While on the course, nothing outside of it had to exist for the time being. It was just my group and the golf course. I only worried about how much club to take, only had to find answers to questions like how I could two-putt from over a massive ridge, and only feared that the round would eventually come to an end. While walking a golf course that looked like it belonged to the land rather than forced into it, my only distraction was the conversation with a good friend that I met through – you guessed it – golf."

What to Expect:  San Francisco Golf Club is one of the great and most historic clubs in America. SFGC takes you back to the roots of golf with club-carrying caddies, no carts, and no yardage markers. Don't expect to see your caddie pulling out a rangefinder to check your yardage, those aren't allowed, caddies simply give you the number based on their vast experience at the course. In fact, each time I've played SFGC I've had caddies with over 30 years of taking loops around the course. The locker room is unquestionably one of the most unique experiences in golf with 100 year old lockers and a vibe like no other place I've been. So historic looking is the locker room that upon entering you'd swear you are going to run into Bobby Jones or Walter Hagen. Masterfully designed by A.W. Tillinghast in 1915, SFCC is a beautiful parkland course that tries to be one thing and one thing only; a pure golf experience. The front nine at SFGC is absolutely fantastic with brilliant use of the natural terrain and several standout holes. The back nine isn't near as good as the front, particularly holes 13-17, which holds it back from being an elite layout. Obviously the course is exceptionally good and has long been revered as a top 25 course, but the club's history and vibe carry it to its status more than just the layout itself. The routing is perfect on the front and very good on the back to create one of the easiest walks in golf. Majestic Monterey Cypress and Pine trees line the wide fairways while additional foliage gives beauty and variety to the property. You won't have to encounter any water hazards throughout the day, but numerous large bunkers along with gentle doglegs and soft elevation changes will be the call of the day. The feature that most players will walk away appreciating the most at San Francisco Golf Club are the greensites with top shelf undulations and bunkering. Ultimately, while SFGC is one of the finest old school experiences in all of golf, Cal Club owns the distinction as the best golf course in the Bay Area.

Individual Hole Analysis
Signature Hole:  7th Hole – 189 Yard Par 3 – The most iconic hole at San Francisco Golf Club, the downhill par three 7th plays to a two-tiered green with bunkers surrounding the putting surface everywhere but immediately in front. Made famous due to being the site of the final legal duel in California, a monument marks the spot where Senator David Broderick lost to California Supreme Court Justice David Terry in 1859. At one point Golf Digest recognized this hole as the 7th best one-shotter in the country. This quality offering is the beginning of an exceptional three hole stretch.

7th Hole at San Francisco Golf Club (189 Yard Par 3)
Best Par 3:  11th Hole – 160 Yards – A quality one-shotter, the 11th features beautiful bunkering along with towering trees creating the backdrop. Playing dead south, a trio of bunkers surround the putting surface while a fourth bunker sits well short and right of the green and would only come into play on the poorest of tee shots. The putting surface is twice as deep as it is wide with the front third sloping forward and the back third sloping to the back. Length isn't the challenge here, it is accuracy and touch that will be needed to conquer it.

11th Hole at San Francisco Golf Club (160 Yard Par 3)
Best Par 4:  8th Hole – 378 Yards – The variety of par fours at SFGC is one of its strong points, however it is this author's opinion that the 378 yard 8th hole, seen in the background of the 7th hole photo above, edges out the strategic 410 yard 10th as the finest two shot hole at the course. Working with the natural terrain, Tillinghast placed the tee box 50 feet below the green on this hole where length isn't the difficult part, it is accuracy and the demanding approach shot to an elevated green that is both slick and undulated. Doglegging to the left off the tee, the fairway is narrow with a steep hill along the left side and thick trees and brush along the right side. A caddie's advice on pin placement is critical when hitting to this green where the majority of the putting surface isn't visible to the golfer and where three putts care certainly more common than birdies.

8th Hole at San Francisco Golf Club (378 Yard Par 4)
Best Par 5:  9th Hole – 582 Yards – Capping off a wonderful stretch of holes on the front nine is the long 582 yard 9th hole. Virtually impossible to reach in two, while playing at Stanford Tiger Woods went driver-driver to come within 15 yards of the green, but still short. For the average human, all you should be concerned with is avoiding the 12 bunkers in play throughout the hole. Your tee shot needs to avoid the series of bunkers on either side of the fairway in the landing zone before having to take your second shot over the high-lipped bunkers that encroach the right side of the fairway. The final shot drops down to a green that has to be attacked from the right side of the hole in order to best take the four surrounding bunkers out of play. A beautiful hole on a beautiful course and the perfect way to finish the front nine.

Birdie Time:  1st Hole – 522 Yard Par 5 – Hopefully you visited the range before teeing off on the 1st hole because that is your best chance for a birdie on the day. A modest 522 yards, the hole is reachable in two and also provides one of the widest fairways at SFGC in which to swing away at. Aim at the right side of the bunker that encroaches the middle of the fairway with your tee shot and then keep your approach shot(s) on the right side of the fairway in order to have the best angle of attack at the green and a chance to start your round one under.

Bogey Beware:  17th Hole – 432 Yard Par 4 – Shot shaping is critical on the 17th hole, a 432 yard two-shotter. There is a sharp dogleg right where a bunker rests on the left corner awaiting tee shots that don't work left to right with the hole. Shots that work too far right have a high probability of finding trouble in the grove of mature trees engulfing the right side of the dogleg. Your approach shot will be haunted by a large bunker well short and right of the green, a green length bunker down the right side of the green, a series of three bunkers stalking the left side of the green, and troublesome trees luring behind the green. Scoring par on this hole will be an excellent momentum boost heading into the finishing hole of the day at a wonderful golf course.

47,Southern Hills,top100,"Tulsa, OK",Perry Maxwell,1936,Southern Hills (Championship),top100golfcourses,rev047_southern_hills_1,"“24 hours from Tulsa” is one of Burt Bacharach’s more famous songs. We’re not sure why it took so long to get to Oklahoma but we’re sure it was worth it in the end, especially if you can befriend a member and secure a tee time at Southern Hills Country Club.

Southern Hills was founded by a group of rich local business during the Great Depression and they commissioned Perry Maxwell, a local Oklahoman, to design the course and it opened for play in 1935.

""Despite its name"", wrote Mike Stachura in American Classic Courses, ""Southern Hills is not a course of dramatic elevation change. Although the 1st and 10th tees are elevated and the 9th and 18th greens are well above the fairway, the remainder of the course is more flattish than not. In short, the topography here does not lend itself to breather holes. Indeed, for championship play the only par fives are the unreachable 655-yard 5th and the 537-yard 13th with water guarding the front of the green.""

According to Tom Doak's The Confidential Guide to Golf Courses Vol 2, ""The routing is chock full of doglegs well defended by trees, and the lack of space to lengthen it significantly has meant that the world's best seldom hit driver, but still face difficult approach shots to Maxwell's tilted greens. Once you move away from the hill by the clubhouse, the undulations are superb and Maxwell capitalized on them all.""

There’s nothing flash about Southern Hills. Mature deciduous trees line many of the Bermuda grass fairways and the rough is notoriously thick and tangly. Apart from the rough and 7,481 championship yards, Southern Hills is there for the taking. But not for long.

In 2018 it was announced that Gil Hanse would spearhead an extensive project aimed at restoring Perry Maxwell’s classic design as part of a $19m facility upgrade. The four-time PGA Championship host, and three-time US Open venue underwent an extensive, 10-month upgrade that finished in June 2019.

All the greens were rebuilt with an underground hydronic system to allow the cooling or heating of putting surfaces as required, with a new bent grass called Pure Distinction utilized to provide firm and fast playing conditions. Bunkers were also reconstructed with a more natural style, replacing the deep, saucer-shaped versions that had evolved down the years.

The course was lengthened by more than 450 yards and the course rating (from the back tees) rose from 76.8 to 78.2 but the slope rating actually fell from 144 to 142, meaning it’s slightly more playable for the average golfer but more difficult for the scratch golfer. Drainage creeks that previously ran underground were also opened up on many holes.

Trees were cleared on the left side of the par four 2nd, creating a split fairway that was shown to exist previously in old aerial photographs, and cart paths were hidden on many of the holes, improving the visual aspect from the tee boxes. The only non-Maxwell green on the course at No. 7 was re-positioned next to a creek with new waterfalls, and trees were removed to accommodate the fairway shifting to the right."
48,Southern Hills,top100,"Tulsa, OK",Perry Maxwell,1936,"Southern Hills Country Club (Tulsa, Oklahoma)",Bill Satterfield,rev048_southern_hills_2,"Southern Hills is a classic major championship layout in the same category as Winged Foot, Baltusrol, and Atlanta Athletic Club. These courses feature an excellent, if not unrelenting, test of golf skill for the best players in the world. Courses in this category have no non-sense designs that focus on the challenge more than they do creativity or aesthetics. As such the bunkering at Southern Hills is simple saucer shaped hazards, the greens are subtle in their design, and the tree lined fairways provide a distinct visual of where to hit the ball. Historically Southern Hills has few rivals in terms of tournaments hosted or ranking among the various Top 100 lists that are published. If these types of courses and experiences are up your alley then Southern Hills will be among your favorites. That being said, I was expecting more from a course that has so long been revered as one of the finest in the country; however the back nine was admittedly an excellent inward nine that helped boost my opinion of Southern Hills.

What to Expect:  Other than Augusta National, Southern Hills stands alongside Pinehurst as the most historic and revered golf course in the South. With a resume that includes hosting four PGA Championships, three U.S. Opens, and a pair of U.S. Amateur Championships, few courses can claim such a rich history with championship golf. The classic Perry Maxwell design features tree lined fairways, rolling hills, and saucer shaped bunkers. A creek meanders through the property, mainly on the front nine, while a few water hazards come into play on the back nine including at the all-world par four 12th hole. The design epitomizes championship golf by featuring a variety of lengths and shapes of holes that will likely require utilizing every club in your bag throughout the round. Many of the holes with shorter approach shots feature the most challenging greens and thus require more precision with your scoring clubs. The opening hole with views of downtown Tulsa and the uphill 9th hole playing towards the clubhouse are worthy of note to be sure, but the back nine is where Southern Hills truly shines with added character, variety, and enjoyment. Caddies are provided and carts are available during your round. You'll also want to soak in the palatial clubhouse that is stock full of golf history.

Individual Hole Analysis
Signature Hole:  12th Hole – 458 Yard Par 4 – Heralded as one of the finest par fours in the country by Arnold Palmer, Ben Hogan, and others, the 12th hole at Southern Hills is a great test from tee to green. The tee shot plays to a raised fairway that is framed by trees on both sides before doglegging left. The fairway slopes from right to left towards a creek that runs up the side before cutting across the hole and to the right of the putting surface. The green is additionally protected by a trio of bunkers that start at the front left and work their way in a half-moon shape around to the back side of the putting surface. The approach shot plays over a creek to a slightly domed green that features tightly mown chipping areas around the front left bunker as well as the area leading to the water. It is easily the best hole on the property and one of the finest in the Midwest.

12th Hole at Southern Hills Country Club (458 Yard Par 4)
Best Par 3:  6th Hole – 200 Yards – This is the hole that Angel Cabrera wished he had never encountered during the 2007 PGA Championship. Angel, paired with fellow 2007 major champions Zach Johnson and Padraig Harrington, famously slaughtered this hole in the opening round after hitting his first ball into the bushes, re-teed and hit his next shot out of bounds, re-teed and hit his next ball into the water. Angel then took a drop, hit it on the green, and proceed to 3-putt his way to a 10. In comparison, his playing partners torched the hole by each carding double bogies. The 200 yard par three plays gently downhill over a creek to a green protected by a pair of saucer shaped bunkers and is one of the more attractive holes at Southern Hills.

6th Hole at Southern Hills Country Club (200 Yard Par 3)
Best Par 4:  18th Hole – 465 Yards – As is so often the case at major championship courses, the final hole is a strong par four that will test every aspect of your game to close out the round. The dogleg right hole requires a well struck drive the stays between the trees and ideally ends up on the flat spot in the fairway up the left without chasing into the creek that encroaches in prior to the cross bunkers. The inspiring second shot is played uphill towards the sprawling clubhouse that sits at the highest point on the property thus providing an excellent vantage point to the course's final hole. The elevated green is one of the most penal on the course as it can reject shots back towards the surrounding bunkers or down the hill. The stout slope found on the putting surface will make a 2-putt anything but routine from most locations on the green. It was here that Retief Goosen famously missed a two foot putt that would have sealed the 2001 U.S. Open. Fortunately for the South African, he was able to win the title in an 18 hole playoff the next day.

18th Hole at Southern Hills Country Club (465 Yard Par 4)
Best Par 5:  13th Hole – 537 Yards – With just two par fives on the property, players should be excited about the opportunity to play this hole that features more character than most any other on the course. A full 120 yards shorter than the lone par five on the front, the 13th hole give players an opportunity to reach this green in two particularly if they challenge the slight dogleg left. A clear view of the target isn't always afforded here so players need to be aware of the two ponds that front the green as well as the circle of bunkers located around the putting surface. Getting above the hole will provide a slick downhill putt that rolls quickly back towards a chipping area squeezed between two of the fronting bunkers. High risk and high reward is the call of the day on the 13th hole which provides the best scoring opportunity the rest of the way at Southern Hills.

13th Hole at Southern Hills Country Club (537 Yard Par 5)
Birdie Time:  11th Hole – 173 Yard Par 3 – Southern Hills' shortest hole is also its easiest. Though the green is surrounded by four bunkers, the first par three on the back nine plays shorter than the yardage due to the elevated tee and should put a club in your hand that gives you oodles of confidence to go pin seeking. This hole has been aced more than any other on the course and thus also creates the best chance for you to card a birdie.

11th Hole at Southern Hills Country Club (173 Yard Par 3)
Bogey Beware:  2nd Hole – 486 Yard Par 4 – Head Professional Dave Bryan calls this the most demanding driving hole on the golf course due to the 260 yard carry over the cross bunkers and contending with a winding creek that cuts and runs parallel to the fairway. Tipping out just under 500 yards, players are faced with a long approach shot to a green that is slightly elevated above the surrounding bunkers. It is a challenging hole that requires two excellent shots in order to record a par."
49,Shoreacres,top100,"Lake Bluff, IL",Seth Raynor,1921,Routing the Ravines: Shoreacres and Seth Raynor,Andy Johnson,rev049_shoreacres_1,"In the far northern suburbs of Chicago, a Seth Raynor masterpiece lies in the sleepy town of Lake Bluff, Illinois. No golf course is more near and dear to my heart than Shoreacres. Growing up in Lake Bluff, I would occasionally stumble across the opportunity to play or walk Shoreacres. These rounds were the highlight of my summer, from a young age I knew there was something special about Shoreacres. It would take me years to figure what that it factor was. What makes Shoreacres special is its routing, in other words, the manner in which the course is laid out over the ground. It is the foundation of the brilliance of Shoreacres and makes for a beautiful walk, and a fun and varied test of golf.
The routing does have its detractors, specifically those who question Raynor’s decision to bypass putting golf holes on Lake Michigan frontage. It’s a parcel few modern architects would pass on, but Raynor knew the best ground for golf laid inland, away from the water. Like most of Chicago, the ground at Shoreacres is very flat. The site’s greatest asset is the dramatic ravine that winds through the property. Raynor used the ravine in a variety of ways throughout the course to create some of the best holes in the world. On the five holes that don’t interact with the ravines, Raynor wisely placed his boldest greens and design features.
1st hole – par 4 – 480yards

The course opens with a par-5 from the members’ tee and a par-4 from the championship tee. The first plays without the presence of the ravine and over flat ground. Its key feature is a set of two massive cross bunkers which split the fairway. This Great Hazard feature was often used by A.W. Tillinghast and puts pressure on players to hit a good tee shot to clear the bunker with their second shot. The 1st green is among the most challenging at Shoreacres. It’s pushed up and guarded by a bunker on the left side. The green has a false front and falls away on the right and back side. The green subtlety moves from front to back making a pitch shots from short of the green sneaky fast.
2nd hole – par 4 – 358 yards

The second presents golfers with their first encounter with the ravine that plays a role on 13 of Shoreacres 18 holes. At the second it cuts across the front of the fairway on a diagonal and runs up the left side of the hole. The second is Shoreacres’ Cape template and presents a number of different strategic choices. Aggressive play can yield a short pitch shot into the green but carries the risk of finding the creek and ravine up the left. A safe play is a long-iron up the right side, but it leaves a short iron approach from a poor angle into a green that slopes right to left. A subtle aspect of the second is the orientation of the green. It is slightly angled to the left, giving an advantage to the player who is aggressive and finds the left side from the tee. The approach shot has to deal with the creek which wraps around the green and makes a player think twice before flag hunting. The second gives players a glimpse of what’s to come and is one of America’s finest renditions of the Cape Hole.
3rd hole – par 4 – 312 yards

The 3rd hole moves up a small rise in the property and is one of the five holes devoid of the ravine on property. The short par-4 is an example of the Leven template. Much like the first, without a ravine, Raynor ramped up the design features, with a giant forebunker, a fronting mound, and a remarkable green. The green slopes severely from back to front and has a front and back tier. In the middle of the putting surface there is a knob which diverts shots back down to the front if they aren’t struck with the perfect touch. The third begs long players to go for it from the tee, but will leave a pitch shot that feels as awkward as a breakup call.
4th hole – par 4 – 393 yards

The ravine returns on the breathtaking 4th hole cutting across the front of the fairway and this time running up the right side. Sheridan Road and out of bounds runs up the left making the 4th one of the more demanding tee shots on property. The fairway has a swale 300 yards from the tee which can lead to some uneven lies. The green is masterful. It slopes from back to front and has a small thumbprint in the center which makes for difficult long putts.
5th hole – par 4 – 491 yards

The 5th is one of the most difficult par-4s in Chicago. The tee shot is demanding with another helping of out of bounds down the left side and trees to the right. Missing the fairway almost guarantees a layup short of the ravine which cuts across the center of the 5th. A tee shot up the left side provides the best angle to approach the green with a mid to long iron, but brings in the most risk. The green features a false front and a back tier. Par is always a great score at the 5th.
6th hole – par 3 – 214 yards

The 6th is situated on another flat and ravineless part of the property. Again, Raynor employed a bold feature to fill the void. The 6th is Shoreacres’ Biarritz hole, a massive green complex that features a 60 yard long green that’s bisected by a six foot deep swale. The green depth allows the hole to play anywhere from 170 to 230, and orients due east with a cool lake breeze often making it even longer.
7th hole – par 4 – 487 yards

The long par-4 7th tees off over the ravine which runs up the right side. The fairway is abundantly wide and allows a tactical player to set up an angle for their long-iron approach. The 7th is Shoreacres’ Double Plateau green, with its three distinct sections. The front right is the most accessible and sits at ground level. The back right is the smallest section and guarded by bunkers on either side. The most difficult pin to access is the front left pin – it’s guarded by a deep bunker and sits on a plateau. To get a long iron close a player must play up the right side of the fairway.
8th hole – par 3 – 196 yards

Shoreacres turns back east for the par-3 8th, their version of the Eden Hole. Today, the 8th plays over a pond but originally it was the ravine. The pond was damned for irrigation purposes in the ‘60s. For aesthetic continuity, it would be tremendous to see the ravine restored one day. The mid-length par three presents an intimidating shot to the perched and severe green which slopes from back to front and has a subtle false front to repel balls down the apron and into the rough.
9th hole – par 4 – 388 yards

The 9th continues east and away from the ravine. It shares a fairway and dramatic bunkering with the neighboring 18th. There is abundant room to the right to miss but it leaves a longer approach shot from a disadvantaged angle. The ninth is often overlooked but its green evokes discomfort and can sneak up on players.
10th hole – par 4 – 467 yards

The round turns and heads back out to the ravine-scape for the back nine. Kicking things off is perhaps America’s finest rendition of the Road Hole. This brawny par-4 asks players to bite off as much as they can chew from the tee. The primary hazard is a ravine that cuts diagonally up the right side. A daring player who takes on the ravine is rewarded with the ideal angle into the difficult green complex. The green has a severe false front and a deep front left bunker guarding approach shots. It is quite shallow, leading to over-aggressive players finding the back bunker. The 10th is one of the finest holes in America.
11th hole – par 4 – 371 yards

After the 10th, Raynor hits his crescendo in the routing with the jaw-dropping 11th. Critics of Raynor often claim “a lack of creativity and over-dependence on templates.” The stretch of 11-15 is Raynor’s counterpoint to those critics. The 11th is what I would call a “found golf hole”. The great ravine which stretches across the property traverses in front of the tee, down the right side and back in front of the green. It’s as dramatic of an inland hole that exists in golf. It calls for a long-iron or fairway wood off the tee. The ravine cuts out and back in, making the right side far more narrow than it appears from the tee. The short-iron approach is forced to carry the ravine onto a green with a big false front that slopes from right to left. If the 11th doesn’t get your juices flowing, I would suggest finding another hobby.
12th hole – par 3 – 136 yards

The routing moves on to the most photographed hole at Shoreacres, the Short par-3 12th which plays down into the ravine. Further illustrating the variety of the routing, on the 8th, Raynor asked players to play over the ravine, now they play into. The downhill shot and trees make it difficult to judge the wind and distance into the terrifying green. The false front is quick to send shots inches short of perfection back into the bunker. Any approach that’s slightly past the pin faces a slippery putt and missing pin high will leave a swinging birdie putt. Nothing good happens to those who miss long. The 12th is as equally maddening to players as it is beautiful.
13th hole – par 4 – 323 yards

Many architects would have avoided going back into this corner of the property for fear of not being able to get out. Not so with Raynor. His routing is at full octane on the short par-4 13th where players hit out of the ravine. The blind tee shot calls for a long-iron and will leave a short-iron or wedge approach shot. The ravine runs up the left side of the hole and again cuts across the front of the green forcing players to hit over it on their approach. Finding the fairway is a must at the 13th because of the vexing green complex. The 13th has the most severe false front that takes up the front quarter of the green. The approach shot tests players’ distance and spin control. Shots too strong find a back trench bunker and shots a few feet too short will be rejected by the front.
14th hole – par 3 – 216 yards

The par-3 14th plays parallel to the 6th and is Shoreacres Redan Hole. The ravine cuts in front and along the left side, very much in play for a player who overcooks a draw. The green slopes hard right to left and front to back. An ideal shot will find the front right of the green and feed back to the pin but comes with the risk of a miss long (dead) or short (awkward).
15th hole – par 5 – 529 yards

The fifteenth is the final hole on the most dramatic piece of the property and is one of the finest par-5s in all of golf. The tee shot tests a player’s appetite for risk. The par five doglegs around the ravine on the left side, giving those who take it up the left a far shorter approach for their second. The ravine then cuts across the fairway setting up a heroic carry for the second shot. The fairway on the other side of the ravine is split into a right and left side by a series of centerline bunkers. Carrying the bunkers earns a player the reward of a downslope which will propel shots onto one of the course’s largest greens. The putting surface slopes from back to front and has a prominent back tier and difficult pin positions.
16th hole – par 4 – 463 yards

The 16th is Shoreacres final difficult par-4, with the ravine running in front of the fairway and up the right side. The landing area for tee shots is generous, but is followed by the challenge of a long second shot into the difficult and well-guarded green. Flanked by bunkers on the right and left, the small 16th green is perched and slopes from back to front. It’s welcoming to a run up shot but any miss will make for a tough up-and-down.
17th hole – par 4 – 347 yards

The 17th turns back and signals the start of the jaunt towards the clubhouse. The short par-4 provides a number of options from the tee. The ravine again cuts in front and up the left of the hole, turning into the manmade lake that fronts the 8th. The 17th fairway sits on a slight angle that makes it play narrower the further a player advances their tee shot. A safe play is to layup to a good number in the 100-150 yard range. A long hitter could drive the green in the right conditions but faces the dangers of native grass right and the course’s deepest bunker on the left. The green is the star of the 17th. Heavily guarded by bunkers, the front section is narrow and makes for a difficult approach. The back portion has a right and left half – over the bunker left has some punchbowl tendencies while the back right offers a small shelf.
18th hole – par 4 – 558 yards

The home hole is Shoreacres’ longest par-5 and is littered with strategic bunkering tee to green. The fairway pinches for long hitters thanks to a deep and bold bunker. A long player can reach the green in two but a miss in the wrong spot makes for a difficult par. The 18th green is one of the best on the course. For pins on the right, it’s wise to set up the third with a shot up the left side. Conversely, for a right pin, a layup of the right is preferred."
50,Shoreacres,top100,"Lake Bluff, IL",Seth Raynor,1921,Shoreacres,top100golfcourses,rev050_shoreacres_2,"Shoreacres is located on Chicago’s north shore. Seth Raynor, who built Camargo around the same time before going on to design Yale and Fishers Island, constructed Shoreacres in 1919. Tom Doak's Renaissance Design was involved in course restoration work in 1993, increasing green sizes amongst other modifications.

When you arrive at Shoreacres, you can almost feel a throwback in time to the 1920s as you approach the David Alder clubhouse. The course is unique and challenging with several ravines and creeks that come into play. With narrow tree-lined fairways and large, fast greens which are heavily bunkered, accuracy at Shoreacres is more important than length.

The acclaimed stretch from the 10th to 15th holes is regarded as Raynor’s finest. It begins with a 452-yard version of the Road Hole (complete with out of bounds to the right) and ends with the scenic 521-yard Shoreacres signature hole which requires a bold tee shot which must carry a ravine to have any chance of reaching this par five in two shots. Even then, finding the green isn’t straightforward. Bunkers guard the right and left side of this back to front sloping green. The 15th is not the toughest hole on the course but it’s a supremely strategic example of a short par five.

Darius Oliver, in this short extract from the book Planet Golf USA, writes: “Aside from some terrific individual holes, what makes Shoreacres such an interesting course is its evenness and Raynor’s clever use of the topography. His greens and bunkers are well positioned and the fairways flow with enough variety to keep players on their guard. This layout is a little short for today’s star golfer, but for the average guy able to look beyond length and slop ratings this is one of Chicago’s premier places to play.”"
51,Somerset Hills,top100,"Bernardsville, NJ",A.W. Tillinghast,1918,Somerset Hills,top100golfcourses,rev051_somerset_hills_1,"Somerset Hills Country Club is an A.W. Tillinghast creation and it’s naturally natural with nothing brash or ostentatious about the course. With glorious green sites and a pretty layout, it’s a course that’s waiting to steal your affections. But first of all you’ll need to befriend a kindly member because Somerset Hills is yet another of America’s prestigious private clubs.

Located in Bernardsville, New Jersey, Somerset Hills is perhaps one of Tilly’s finest creations and it’s a jewel that fits the contrasting land like a silk glove, where there's plenty of variation to keep everyone happy (length of holes and green sites), Somerset Hills is an unusual layout that flows cleverly around the flat, open, links-like terrain of a former racetrack for the outward nine and across hilly, dense woodland for the homeward half.

Author Darius Oliver wrote in his book Planet Golf USA: “Somerset Hills Country Club has diligently preserved this great track and they deserve great credit for resisting the urge to modify holes or soften their marvelous green shapes.

At various times they have had issues with tree growth and the loss of playing areas, but in recent years a carefully supervised restoration program has successfully returned much of the layout to the original Tillinghast plan.

What’s cool about the course are not the things that Tillinghast experimented with here and then took on later projects, but the unique design features that he rarely tried anywhere else.”

Perhaps the pick of the holes is the par four 15th which is flanked by trees creating intimacy. The fairway slides downhill and then doglegs to the right to reveal perhaps the largest green on the Jekyll and Hyde course that is Somerset Hills.

The Bernardsville layout has been revised down the years as follows: William Gordon (1946); Hal Purdy (1956 and 1968); Tom Doak (2010 and 2013) with consultant Brian Slawnik of Renaissance Golf Design. In 2017 Brian suggested altering the par five 10th to a short par four, allowing holes 11 and 18 to be lengthened."

From the false front Bunker Hill green, to the alps-like Dolomites green, and to the classic Redan green, Somerset Hills is a fun test with the flat stick. The hillier and water filled back nine is quite different from the tamer and more open front nine. Like many Tillinghast courses, the par 5s are nothing to write home about. However, the collection of par threes are nothing short of stellar and several of the two-shotters are holes you won't soon forget and will want to play again and again. The locker room is intimate and the atomosphere is classy but not stuffy at the clubhouse and restaurant. Fantastic views are had from the balcony where you can sip down a beverage and enjoy the evening.

Individual Hole Analysis
Signature Hole:  11th Hole – 412 Yard Par 4 – (Perfection) - Perfection is a good adjective for this downhill dogleg right hole. Water is featured along the left side of the second half of the hole and will drown a tee shot that is played too long off the tee. The approach shot is played across a creek to a undulated green that will only reward the best of strokes. It is a gorgeous inland hole and the start of a special stretch of holes on the back nine.

11th Hole at Somerset Hills Country Club (412 Yard Par 4)
Best Par 3:  2nd Hole – 175 Yards – (Redan) - While the setting of this Redan hole is not near as impressive as National Golf Links, Shinnecock, or Yale, the terrain at this site was a perfect fit. Taking dead aim at a pin position anywhere other than the front right portion of the green is a risky proposition and should only be executed when you are ""in the zone."" The slope off to the left side of the green is the most severe of any Redan we've played to date.

Best Par 4:  15th Hole – 407 Yards – (Happy Valley) - From the tee this hole doesn't appear to be anything special, but after hitting your tee shot up the hill and following the dogleg right you are faced with a beautiful view to a green that is front by a stone lined creek. A big drive with a fade can catch the downslope and run quite toward the green while a miscue with the driver will likely lead to a layup shot. The downhill approach shot is exhilarating and rewarding when executed properly. From tee to green, this is the best hole at Somerset Hills.

Best Par 5:  6th Hole – 501 Yards – (Plateau) - The evidence of the old horse race track comes into view on the 6th hole. This dogleg right measures just three feet over 500 yards and is thus very reachable in two strokes. The mounding and bunkering around the green coupled with the heavily treed backdrop make a nice framework to this green site.

Birdie Time:  12th Hole – 151 Yard Par 3 – (Despair) - Even though there is water the entire left side of this hole, the short par three 12th delivers an excellent chance to score a birdie. A low iron or wedge will be in your hand and you will have a perfect lie and be hitting to a fairly tame green; all good elements for making a two.

Bogey Beware:  3rd Hole – 378 Yard Par 4 – (Bunker Hill) - The scorecard rates this hole as the 11th handicap, but whenever you are faced with a severe uphill tee shot to a green that will literally send balls 40 yards back down the fairway then you have a challenge on your hands. If the pin is back then the previous hole, Dolomites, might be bogey time since it features one of the craziest greens I've ever seen with a series of severe hills designed into it. However, if the pin is in the front on #3 (like the photo below), there is a good chance you will leave your approach short and watch it cascade back down the fairway; or you may just three putt from the back of the green since fear should reside in your soul as you tentatively approach the hole but fear going beyond it and back down the hill."

Macan, 1926/Alister MacKenzie, 1928/Kyle Phillips, 2007",1926,California Golf Club of San Francisco,top100golfcourses,rev053_california_gc_sf_1,"The California Golf Club of San Francisco dates back to the Golden Age of design and, although the club can trace its roots back to 1918, California Golf Club did not truly come of age until it moved to its present site in the mid 1920s.

The club originally commissioned little known Scotsman Willie Lock to design the course on the new site in the fashionable Bay Area, but an Irishman, Arthur Vernon Macan, replaced him before construction started. It’s unclear as to why Locke was replaced by Macan but we do know that Locke routed California, so he should receive posthumous credit. Alister MacKenzie was drafted in to address shortfalls in California’s bunkering in 1927 and since then the club’s reputation soared.
Former Walker Cup player Gene Andrews won the US Senior Men's Amateur Championship here at the California Golf Club of San Francisco in 1970, which was probably the club’s proudest moment.

In 2005, after years of struggling with putting surfaces infested with roundworms, the club decided to rebuild the greens and Kyle Phillips was the chosen architect following a dramatic proposal. Not only did Phillips rebuild the greens, he also built five new holes so that the club could boast a stronger outward nine to complement the existing excellent homeward nine.

According to his official website “Kyle Phillips Golf Course Design renovated and restored the course using 1927 as a benchmark when Dr Alister MacKenzie re-bunkered the course. The original course, designed by A. Vernon Macan, had been compromised in the 1960s when San Bruno Creek gave way to the existing Westborough Road, leaving only 13 of the original holes intact… The first event at the newly renovated course was highlighted with a 6-hole exhibition by PGA Tour player Arron Oberholser and former U.S. Open Champion Ken Venturi hitting the ceremonial first ball.”

The California Golf Club of San Francisco can now boast tournament measurements. From the new back tees, which are aptly called Venturi, the course can be stretched to more than 7,200 yards.

The following edited extract by George Waters is from Volume Six of Golf Architecture: A Worldwide Perspective. 

“The California Club of San Francisco completed work a few years ago that nicely illustrates the value of component restoration. Before the project, the course was a scramble of different designs. The original routing had been substantially altered by land sales and highway projects. Some very interesting holes playing along a creek had been lost for ever.

Although Alister MacKenzie had performed a complete redesign of the course’s bunkering early in the club’s history, years of wear and tear, tinkering and redesign had stolen nearly all of the character from his work. Newly constructed ponds and other impromptu features further detracted from what is arguably the best golfing ground held by any of the courses in San Francisco.

Kyle Phillips, the entrusted architect, approached the two nines differently. The routing of the back nine was more or less intact, and there was a reasonable amount of photographic evidence regarding MacKenzie’s bunkering. Phillips worked very closely with the original holes on the back nine, deviating only slightly from a full restoration.

The front nine was a different story. This was where large parts of the original course had been lost and where photographic record was limited. Philips had to devise some creative solutions to these holes to get the most out of the property. By relocating the practice area away from the clubhouse he was able to make use of some exciting terrain that was previously unused.

He also engaged in large-scale earthwork to recreate the feel and playing characteristics of the lost creekside holes. At the same time, Phillips kept the bunkering style consistent and chose to restore selected elements. This kept the front nine consistent with the back nine; additionally, it connected the history of the course. The result is a design that uses the property to the best advantage, while making a strong connection with the past. The ‘Cal Club’ represents a highly successful component restoration.”"

Macan, 1926/Alister MacKenzie, 1928/Kyle Phillips, 2007",1926,"The California Golf Club Of San Francisco (South San Francisco, California)",Bill Satterfield,rev054_california_gc_sf_2,"There is a contentious debate among golfers, and certainly among members, of which private course in San Francisco is the best. While some contend it is the Lake course at Olympic Club with its shot shaping and history of hosting U.S. Opens, and others argue that it is San Francisco Golf Club with its old school charm and intimate routing, I am firmly in the camp that The California Golf Club is comfortably the best course in the Bay Area. The movement in the terrain, and the way the holes are designed within it, represent some of the best work I’ve seen. A masterful variety of uphill and downhill shots are required while also rewarding players that can shape their ball when needed; though the fairways offer plenty of width to navigate within. The tees and fairways feature fescue grass which plays firm and fast while the bentgrass greens roll pure and with pace. The renovation that Kyle Phillips did was masterful and features some of the most attractive bunkering you will find at any course in the world, especially with how the edging compliments the shape of the Monterey tree tops. The afternoons at Cal Club are notoriously windy and temperatures rarely get very warm so having a jacket or sweater handy is recommended while pants are mandatory. You’ll also have a caddie to help carry your clubs and navigate the course since walking is required the majority of the time. In the end, Cal Club has few peers when it comes to exceptional variety in terrain, hole shapes, and overall design; it is simply one of the best inland courses in the world.

Individual Hole Analysis
Signature Hole:  16th Hole – 133 Yard Par 3 – An under-utilized design feature in a routing but found at great courses such as Sand Hills and Cypress Point, a short par three late in the round is revealed as the 16th hole at The Cal Club. Like the 12th at Augusta National, winds swirl here and create havoc with club selection, especially since you'll be hitting a club that will launch high in the air and receive maximum exposure to the gusts. The kidney-shaped green is twice as wide as it is deep and is encircled by seven bunkers that protect every edge except the front left portion of the putting surface. The biggest mistake you can make here is to have a lack of commitment, so despite whatever conditions you have no control over, commit to the club and swing that will give you the best opportunity to stick the green. 5s are as common as 2s here, but at just 133 yards and playing downhill, it is gettable by every range of handicap.

16th Hole at The California Golf Club of San Francisco (133 Yard Par 3)
Best Par 3:  12th Hole – 232 Yards – I fell in love with this hole the moment I laid eyes on it. A beautiful setup with the green perched on a high spot with a valley fronting it and a series of tee boxes working their way up the opposite hillside is unveiled at the 12th while the towering Monterey pines on each side frame in the setting. The tee shot threads the 11th and 18th greens enroute to a putting surface that is protected by seven bunkers; most of which are found on the left side of the hole. A front right pin is the most accessible while back left takes some serious game to hit a tee shot close to. I love par threes that play a bit uphill while still offering a glimpse of the putting surface, and this one is top shelf.

12th Hole at The California Golf Club of San Francisco (232 Yard Par 3)
Best Par 4:  7th Hole – 411 Yards – There are so many good two-shotters at The Cal Club that it is a shame to feature just one, but the 7th certainly stands out as the most dramatic and memorable. Found on the western side of the property, the 7th runs along a ridge that features tons of falloff on each side of the fairway and the right side being the most prevalent in view as the fairway capes around it. Balls that don't find the short grass will likely go MIA for the rest of your round so it is imperative you keep your tee ball in play. Carrying the bunker complex on the corner will require 255 yards of carry which doesn't seem that difficult, but with the prevailing wind coming in from the west it is quick to knock down tee shots since they will be traveling west north west towards their destination. The fairway tilts left to right and tumbles downhill towards the green requiring players to play their approach shot short and let their ball trundle onto the putting surface. With the mountain of South San Francisco creating the backdrop and the ravines creating a sense of isolation, the setting for the 7th is fantastic.

7th Hole at The California Golf Club of San Francisco (411 Yard Par 4)
Best Par 5:  17th Hole – 567 Yards – The words ""South San Francisco The Industrial City"" painted on the mountain in the backdrop creates an ideal aiming point on the 17th hole, though going up the left side of the fairway can be beneficial considering the left-to-right tilt the fairway features. The bunkers on the right side are easily carried but leaking a tee shot to the right of them will get into the trees or potentially work its way out of bounds, so the miss here is definitely to the left. After ascending uphill with the tee shot, players crest the hill and find the fairway switches to a right-to-left tilt and steadily descends 50 feet enroute to the green that is littered with bunkers on each side. The ideal approach shot carries the bunker complex that is 50 yards short of the green on the left side and then catches the slope that will send balls bounding to the right towards the putting surface. The good shots here can get you home in two, and even if you are a little short, there is a good opportunity to wedge a shot close and walk away with a birdie before heading to the finishing hole.

17th Hole at The California Golf Club of San Francisco (567 Yard Par 5)
Birdie Time:  1st Hole – 535 Yard Par 5 – The opening hole is as generous as Cal Club is going to get with this downhill par five to start off with. The fairway tumbles downhill from tee to the green which makes this hole it very reachable in two; particularly with the firm conditions. 280 yards up the left side is a fairway bunker that you'll want to avoid but stands as a nice aiming point to hit a little cut off of. The front of the green is receptive with just a bunker pinching in from the right to be aware of, but an aerial or ground shot here should find the green. In fact, you'll want to play a shot that lands short of the front edge since balls will kick forward onto the putting surface. There are plenty of challenging holes at Cal Club to contend with, so go get yourself a birdie here and build up some insurance early.

1st Hole at The California Golf Club of San Francisco (535 Yard Par 5)
Bogey Beware:  3rd Hole – 437 Yard Par 4 – Dubbed by many as the signature hole at Cal Club, the 3rd is a strong par four that bends to the right around some tall pines and difficult bunkering. It is tempting to challenge the corner, but with over 300 yards to carry the sand and trees that swat down shots more often than seeing balls sail over them, the prudent play is up the left half of the fairway. However, the further left you go the more the greenside bunkering comes into play that laces the left side of the putting surface. The circular green is less than 5,000 sq.ft. and doesn't provide a large target if approaching the green from mid-iron length. The downhill nature of the tee shot puts a premium on accuracy and the tightness of the ideal landing spots amps things up even more, so you'll need to be on your best game to find a green in regulation here."

The place has a reputation for being a relic of a bygone age – where ‘men were men’ and women were neither seen nor heard. The reputation is fully deserved.

There is a sign welcoming you to the club making it clear that jackets must be warn at all times. Actually, that only applies to the inside lounge and dining areas. You can eat on the terrace outside sans jacket without fear of being kicked off of the premises.

For sure this place has some quirks. The locker room is the closest thing I have seen to a school changing room for over 25 years, in fact I imagine there are few school changing rooms in the Western hemisphere as antiquated as this. There are only 399 members at the club – apparently if they got to 400 members they would have to start allowing women some rights of access which the members aren’t ready for just yet.
Garden City Golf Course
So yes, there are some odd things going on but the people we met were all very friendly and charming and didn’t seem to mind my pink shorts one bit!

So, to the course. This had hidden gem written all over it before we played. The course is built on sandy land, but not a links. I had been led to expect something more akin to one of England’s heath courses. As always the Golf Club Atlas site was a great source of background reading with this write-up here - http://golfclubatlas.com/courses-by-country/usa/garden-city/.  You will read there how the course was crafted by Devereux Emmet and significantly developed by Walter Travis following the 1902 US Open. 

And so, it was with a real sense of expectation we wondered onto the first tee – a 300 yard par 4.  A perfect yardage for my first hole! We had a couple of perfectly good caddies – mine was an Irish guy who worked hard to endear himself all the way round – who assured us we were in for something quite special.

And, I’m afraid it didn’t quite hit the mark for me. Maybe it was that we came to Garden City having played some of the real top drawer courses in the area and were too blinded by what we had seen but it just felt a bit, well, OK. The course was very playable – open and everything was in front of you at all times. It is said by some to be a triumph of minimalism, actually we found it a little featureless.  Sure the bunkering was interesting (many of which were upturned which was an unusual addition) and there was a lot of strategy involved with putting together a good score I’m sure, but the course never really got the juices flowing.
Garden City Golf
Don’t get me wrong there was much to enjoy – there’s a nice gentle opening par 4 followed by a lovely short par 3 over a quarry. The course then heads out through a very pleasant few holes which will use plenty of the clubs in your bag. Tom Doak did a lot of work on the course a few years ago and without a doubt there is plenty to keep you interested – especially around the greens. Looking back on my round here I can’t really remember that many of the holes clearly – not a great sign. The finish was again an interesting one – the par 5 17th yielded an eagle from our group before the knee-knocking finishing hole.  A mid length par 3 over water. I managed a big hook to the first tee which made for an unusual angle for my second!

After the round we enjoyed a tour of the clubhouse.  As you would expect for a place that hosted a US Open, 4 US Amateurs and a Walker Cup all before 1936 was out there is much to see.  The club historian was there and did a great job at telling us some of the stories from the past - you really felt that you were stepping back in time.

This was a hard course to score. If you were a real architectural nut who was there to appreciate every nuance of the ground maybe you would appreciate it more. For me, I just couldn’t fathom how this had a place in the top 100 in the world. One of my playing partners showed his Neanderthal qualities in the extreme by suggesting quite volubly on the drive back to Manhattan when he suggested it wasn’t much better than a local council course in the UK.

That was harsh for sure. However, it is probably a course to go in with you expectations low and prepare to be surprised and delighted rather than think it will be the highlight of your golfing life!

BOOKING THE COURSE

Well, there are 399 members and one of them has to invite you as far as I can see, therefore this isn’t the easiest tee time in the world to snag.. There are some high end travel agencies who claim they can get you onto ‘bucket list’ experiences so maybe give one of them a try but if truth be told I wouldn’t pay too much for the honour.

TOUR TIPS

Garden City is very doable from Manhattan – time depending you can drive it within an hour – and is a good stop-off on the way to the Hamptons. That’s about all I have to say I’m afraid as we came in and out quite quickly! June and September may be the best months to play – out of the cold winter months and away from the oppressive summer heat and storms."

The strict men-only policy of this exclusive club puts it in the limelight for all the wrong reasons.

In 1897, when the course first opened for play on the Hempstead Plain in Long Island Village, it was in the middle of rural countryside. Today, Garden City Golf Club is an oasis in the middle of suburban sprawl.
Devereux Emmet originally designed the course in 1896. In 1902, the 9th US Open was staged here – Laurie Auchterlonie was the eventual winner. Walter Travis made some modifications to the course in the Roaring Twenties and he can probably claim to have turned Garden City into the fascinating layout that it is today.

The ground is ostensibly light loam so many people classify Garden City as an inland links or a heathland course. Classifying Garden City as either a links or heathland course would be wrong, even though it does possess many of their characteristics.

Garden City is a course for the minimalists, so it's just as well Tom Doak completed a restoration programme here in 2015. There’s nothing bold or brash about Garden City it’s just a simple, natural course which does everything in a reassured but understated way.

In the book Planet Golf USA, author Darius Oliver writes: “The topography at Garden City isn’t overly dramatic, but the course is beautifully routed and the designers did a superb job squeezing quality holes out of fairly unremarkable landforms. With plenty of half-par holes and hazards arranged to create genuine risk/reward dilemma, Garden City is particularly well suited to matchplay… Steeped in the traditions of early American golf, Garden City is an unpretentious treasure that continues to excite and delight.”"

When I first began this site I was extremely diligent in writing about every top course I played (and even many not-so-top courses).

The reality is, between the writing, photo editing, and promotion – each post takes a lot of time to put together, and frankly as much as I love golf, I have a business to run as well.


However as April has turned into May, the weather begins to turn and I just received my copy of “How to Play the World’s Most Exclusive Golf Clubs” I’ve found myself getting back into golf mode.

In the next month I have rounds lined up at Garden City, Merion, Philly Cricket Club, Aronimink and possibly a few others that let’s just say, have me really looking forward to the summer golfing season.

Now, because of my lack of writing (and photo editing for that matter), I’m left with nearly two dozen top 100 courses that I’ve played – but have yet to do a proper write up on.

So as I was thinking back about where to start, there was one obvious choice that sticks out as one of the most enjoyable rounds I’ve played on my quest: Maidstone Club.

My First Trip to the Hamptons

Early last spring I received an email through this blog that said simply:

“Sean, I’d love to extend an invitation to play Maidstone and maybe the National if you’re ever out on Long Island.”

As you can imagine, my response was pretty much “I will fly to Long Island, at any time, on any day, under whatever terms you desire, if we can make this work.”

Ok, that’s not quite what I said, but I essentially said I’d be happy to plan a trip around it.

A few months later, I’d planned my New York trip – and up until the week before I wasn’t totally sure if it would happen or not.

However the day finally came, and in one of those “I hope I don’t get murdered scenarios” – my host picked me up in Manhattan around 10pm after he got done working, and we made the 2.5 hour drive to East Hampton together – having never shared more than a couple lines of text back and forth in emails.

The plan was to stay at his mom’s house in East Hampton, play in the morning and then I was going to take a bus back later that evening.


Well, the one thing he forgot to mention was that his mom’s “house” was a palatial estate less than two minutes from the club.

It truly was one of those “how did I end up here?” moments, and was a fitting introduction to “the Hamptons” which I’d always heard so much about.

As I was getting ready to head to sleep that night, I knew it would be a warm day ahead, so I asked my host if shorts were ok to wear.

His response:

“Shorts are fine, but would you mind shaving?”

My unshaven “homeless chic” look probably wasn’t going to illicit the best first impression to the club and his fellow members.

He had to let me borrow a razor.

Maidstone First Impressions

We woke up the next morning and headed to the course. We had to be done by noon as there was a members event, so we were getting an early start.

The day was absolutely perfect. 

A light breeze, not a cloud in the sky, and I was literally giddy.

This was one of my first true experiences with a “fortress club” or an extremely private club where they usually don’t allow people like me in – so I was going to savor every second.

We spent some time on the range and practiced our short game before heading to the first tee – which truly had a magical feel.

The ocean is directly behind the tee, and you’re teeing off into a place very few people have the privilege of seeing.


We would be playing with Dave and David, two other guests of the club. Both of whom I’ve kept in touch with, and the latter of which hosted me for what would be my most enjoyable round of 2016 up to this point, down at his club near Miami.

The Course

Unlike some of it’s other Long Island brethren like Shinnecock or Bethpage Black – Maidstone is not known for being a ball-busting course.

In fact from the tips it measures just over 6600 yards, so hardly menacing in length by anyone’s standards.

I didn’t know a whole lot about the course itself before teeing off. What I did know however was that it had a reputation for having a weak start, a weak finish, and some world class holes in between.

Did I agree? Let’s find out.

Hole 1 (Par 4, 424 Yards)

As I mentioned, the opening tee shot at Maidstone is one of the few I’ve had lately where I legitimately had butterflies. I was excited, and there were a number of other members waiting to tee off behind me, so I was just doing everything in my power not to embarrass myself.

I found the first hole to be the perfect opener.

You had a big wide open fairway on your tee shot, so as long as you stayed out of the fairway bunker on the right, you’re in good shape.

Also, the approach to the plateau green made you think, but it wasn’t anything too scary.

My perfect kind of opening hole.

You can also immediately see the work that had been done by Coore-Crenshaw, with some of their signature blown out bunkering that would become a theme for the rest of the course.

Maidstone Hole 1

 

Hole 2 (Par 5, 537 yards)

The second was a mid-length par 5 with bunkers to be aware of on both sides of the fairway. Accuracy is demanded, but electing to hit 3 wood brings the rather large bunker on the right into play.



Maidstone Hole 2

Hole 3 (Par 4, 408 yards)

We get our first bit of elevation change on the 3rd, which is a mid-length par 4.

The tee shot is relatively benign as long as you aren’t too far left or right, but the approach is surrounded by bunkers to an undulating green.

Maidstone Hole 3


Hole 4 (Par 3, 250ish from new tees)

This is where I feel things really start stepping up.

What used to be a fairly simple par 3, has apparently recently received some steroids injected into it.

On the card, this hole plays 176 from the back tees.

Well apparently the cards hadn’t been updated, because we got to play it from the new tees which stood at a stout 251 yards out. Yes, for a “short” course, that’s a serious par 3. Especially because anything short is looking at bunkers or lake.

Maidstone Hole 4 Small



Hole 5 (Par 4, 325 yards)

Ah, my favorite type of hole – the short par 4!

And this is about as good as they come in my book.

From the tips its a solid poke at 325, but depending on which tees your playing and what the wind is doing this could be reachable.

This is a really strategic hole.

Do you hit driver and risk a slice or hook into the wetlands or water? Or bombing it over the green into the water?

Do you back off and go hybrid or three wood, which brings the bottle neck of bunkers into play just short of the green?

Or do you play smart and hit an iron into the middle of the fairway.

There’s no right or wrong answer, but just be willing to live with the choices you make 🙂

Oh, and try not to be distracted by the houses in the background that cost more than you’ll make in a lifetime…

Maidstone Hole 5



Hole 6 (Par 4, 403 yards)

6 and 7 are back to back cape holes (with 6 being a bit of a psuedo-cape design).

You tee off to a diagonal fairway over marsh land, and the farther right you go, the longer the carry (but shorter the approach).

Too far left and you’re in the bunkers, or way too far left and you’re into the marsh.

The green slopes strongly left to right, and will be a challenge regardless of where the pin is. One of my favorite greens on the course.

The approach on 6.
The approach on 6.

Hole 7 (Par 4, 341 yards)

Seven is a proper cape hole over water. Bite off as much as you want.

I watched a big banana slice go into the water, before playing it a bit safer on my second shot.

But a well struck ball to the left side of the fairway should leave you with an easy approach.

Maidstone Hole 7

Hole 8 (Par 3, 151 yards)

The 8th at Maidstone is one of the most unique holes on the course. From the teebox, only the left side of the green is visible, so depending on where the pin is that day, you could be facing a blind tee shot.



It’s also a phenomenal example of a course that seamlessly blends into the landscape. The bunkers look like a natural extension of the dunes.

Maidstone Hole 8

Hole 9 (Par 4, 415 yards)

Walking up onto the all-world 9th hole, you know you’re some place special.

You get your first full glimpse of the ocean, and you’re treated to a beautiful par 4 that takes you down into the dunes, and then right back up again on the approach.

From the tee you have a fantastic view of the course and dunes, and it’s one of those spots where you truly should take a minute and soak it all in. Golf simply doesn’t get much better than this.

The fore bunker that crosses the fairway can throw off your perception, so trust your distance and don’t under club – or risk rolling into one of the scarier bunkers on the course.

Maidstone Hole 9 2Maidstone hole 9 Approach


Hole 10 (Par 4, 401 yards)

The right bunker is in play off the tee as you hit it over the tall grass. From there you’re left with an approach to a large green with trouble on either side.

Hole 11 (Par 4, 464 yards)

The 11th is a big two shotter that takes you back out away from the dunes.

Frankly 11 and 12 are probably two of my least favorite holes on the course – in part because the previous 5 were so good – you do feel a little bit of a let down.

Not like a #6 on Spyglass letdown, but a little bit of one.

Careful of bunkers on both the tee shot and approach.

Maidstone hole 11


Hole 12 (Par 3, 181 yards)

12 is a mid length par 3 that was easily my least favorite on the course. Bunkers on all sides, but lacks the visual interest of 8, the heroic shot of 4, and well, there’s just no comparison to 14.

Maidstone Hole 12

Hole 13 (Par 5, 500 yards)

13 re-engages you with a beautiful par 5 into the dunes which should be reachable for many people depending on the wind.

That said, there is ample trouble off the tee in the form of tall grass and bunkers, so if you aren’t feeling it – don’t be afraid to hit 3 wood.



Maidstone Hole 13

Hole 14 (Par 4, 152 yards)

Standing on the tee at 14, I didn’t want to leave. It’s one of the most special one shot holes in the world.

Not because of the history, the length, or any of that.

But simply because at that point, sitting in a remote spot deep into the dunes looking out at the oean, you’re looking at one of the most beautiful spots in golf as far as I’m concerned.

The winter of 2015 was brutally hard in the NE, and we got really lucky as Maidstone’s greens took significant damage.

I played in mid June, and this green had just been reopened a few days prior. You can still see some of the patches that got filled in if you look closely.

Once again the bunkering is phenomenal, in that it doesn’t look like there are any. It’s that seamless with the natural landscape.

Hole 15 (Par 5, 493 yards)

15 is another reachable par 5, but the tee shot is a bit tricky.



You have to thread the ball between large trees/bushes on both the right and left hand side about 100 yards out, then you have bunkers lining both sides of the fairway.

So a striped drive down the middle leaves you a great shot at a tap in birdie, but if you’re not careful, this hole could just as easily lead to big numbers.

Maidstone Hole 15

Hole 16 (Par 5, 485 yards)

The finishing stretch!

16 is another reachable par 5 (loving these shorter 3 shotters), and is similar to the cap number 7.

Except this time, not only do you have to clear water, but if you’re too far left you have bunkers to clear as well.



A long drive will leave you a mid iron into the green. But how gutsy do you want to be?

Maidstone Hole 16

Hole 17 (Par 4, 328 yards)

The par 4 17th is short on paper, but now features a bit of the reverse of the previous right handed cape holes we’ve seen. You can go for the green, but it’s going to take a big poke to get it there.

A solid shot between the two bunkers straight out is a good line.

The green has some undulation and is a bit tricky, especially if you end up in the bunker on the left.

Maidstone Hole 17 Approach

Maidstone Hole 17

Hole 18 (Par 4, 390 yards)

On 18 you cross the road again and tee off towards the clubhouse to an uphill green. You’ve got bunkers on the left separating the fairway from the 1st and a big bunker on the right waiting to eat up a slice.



Once you get up to the green, you’re once again treated to a spectacular ocean view and the unfortunate realization that your round is over.

Final Thoughts on Maidstone Club

I’ve played a lot of top courses and thought “I’m so glad I played here, but man did that course wear me out.”

Both physically and mentally.

Maidstone is not one of those courses.

Before playing Maidstone, I’d read remarks that it was too short, or that technology had passed it by.

I don’t think that could be farther from the truth.

Maidstone has something that I think few courses truly master: It was a beautiful classic layout, that has very difficult elements (especially when the wind is up), but was also fun as hell to play.

You know me, my primary ranking factor for a course is fun. And because of that Maidstone creeps into my top 10 courses of all time.

I think the Maidstone experience was summed up best on a comment from a recent Instagram post of mine. @dillonmays_ said:

“There are better courses than Stone, but during any day spent there, you can be pretty confident that no one on the planet is having it better than you are.”

Couldn’t agree more, Dillon. Couldn’t agree more."
58,Maidstone,top100,"East Hampton, NY",John Park/Willie Park Jr.,1922,MAIDSTONE CLUB REVIEW,Graylyn Loomis,rev058_maidstone_2,"When I left New York City after my last golf trip to the area, I would have laughed at you if you told me I’d be back four weeks later. But, as fate would have it, I was back in the Hamptons again one month later to play Maidstone Club. This second visit was with my golf buddy Tim, who journeyed over from Edinburgh, Scotland. Our original plan was to spend a weekend in the Philadelphia area, but once rounds started to fall through due to green aeration schedules, we expanded our phone calls to New York. In the end, we played a tremendous round at Merion and then hopped in the car and drove to East Hampton for Maidstone!

We arrived in East Hampton and met our generous host, who put us up for the night in his home. We woke up the next morning and drove to Maidstone, where we had a coffee and muffin in the classic locker room. The entire club exudes that “you are in a very special place” feeling. Maidstone also made history by leaping into the PowerShower Rankings tied for second place with a rating of 8.0. If that isn’t bragging rights, I don’t know what is!

The club was founded in 1891 and the course design has been influenced by some of the best. Without getting into the nitty-gritty, Willie Dunn laid out an original 7-hole course in 1894, which was redesigned in 1924 by Willie Park, Jr. and his brother Jack. That is the course we know today as Maidstone West (there is also a 9-hole course), and Ben Crenshaw and Bill Coore renovated it in 2012. The goal of the renovation was to “unclutter” the course and restore the linksy strategic layout the Park brothers originally built.

Instead of going into details about the renovation here, I will weave highlights throughout the hole-by-hole section below. The renovated green complexes on the course particularly stood out as special, so note them below. The Coore & Crenshaw influence is also evident in the bunkering, and I loved areas where the greens spilled into bunkers. If you are interested in seeing more detail about the renovation, check out this page on the Maidstone Club website. Kudos to the very private club for sharing information about the renovation.

I naturally entered the round wanting to compare it with Shinnecock and National Golf Links of America, both of which I had played four weeks earlier. I left the round realizing that a direct comparison wasn’t the correct approach. Each course has a different vibe and design ethos to offer. Maidstone’s vibe is a great balance of playability and challenge. Short holes are mixed with longer holes, and the moment you discount a short hole as easy, you stare down a putt for double bogey.

Maidstone offers more of the holistic “club” side of things compared to the other two, which are “golf clubs” in the traditional sense of the phrase. Maidstone has a beach club, tennis facilities, and pool, which you won’t find at Shinnecock or NGLA.

Hole #1 – 362 yards – I disagree with those who say that the opening hole is weak at Maidstone. The fairway is wide open, but placement is important to have a good angle into the large, raised green.

Hole #2 – 509 yards – This is the only par 5 on the front nine, and it is reachable for longer hitters. The green is modeled off of the Road Hole at St Andrews and even though the bunker is larger and shallower than the Road Hole Bunker, the similarities are obvious.

Hole #3 – 365 yards – Bunkers line both sides of this fairway and a multi-tiered green adds to the challenge. The right side of this hole received new bunkers during the Coore & Crenshaw renovation.

Hole #4 – 162 yards – This green was expanded during the renovation and in the second photo below, you can see some of the beautiful bunker work on the course. There was also a new tee added at 250 yards, but 170 was plenty of par 3 into the wind!

Hole #5 – 296 yards – It is possible to get close to this green for longer hitters, but not much is gained. A solid long iron leaves a short wedge into the large, but sloping green.

Hole #6 – 393 yards – The 6th starts a stretch of holes that can stand with nearly any other course in the country. A few, including the 6th, are short, but shot placement is key to create the best angles into the tough greens. Don’t equate short and easy.

Hole #7 – 312 yards – This par 4 green is out on the peninsula you see on the right. A waste area runs down the left, so aim center fairway here with a long iron. The greens spills directly into a bunker on the left, and despite the short yardage, there is plenty of opportunity for bogey or worse here.

Hole #8 – 131 yards – As you have seen in these photos, the weather was tricky all day and didn’t allow me to produce great pictures. On this tee we were staring into incredibly bright white clouds. 

The tee shot is blind on this short par 3, so the first photo below was taken on the far left edge of the tee box. The photo below it shows the greenside bunkers and the final of the three photos shows the green looking back at the tee. It’s a great little hole and is one I’d love to play again now that I’ve seen it!

Hole #9 – 367 yards – This beautiful par 4 plays along the Atlantic dunes to a green that spills off the right edge into a mammoth bunker. It reminded me of the par 4s in the seaside dunes at Askernish, in Scotland’s Outer Hebrides. The hole feels very natural.

Hole #10 – 360 yards – The 10th had one of the my favorite greens on the course. The massive false front is tough, but over the green is no relief with a steep drop off into rough. Aim center green and avoid spinning one back into the left bunker… as I did.

Hole #11 – 395 yards – Big hitters can cut off a little bit of this corner, but the best play is to hit a slight draw down the left side of the fairway. The green is deep and was enlarged during the renovation. The bunkering around the green was also restored.

Hole #12 – 164 yards – Another large green here with beautiful bunkering.

Hole #13 – 454 yards (par 5) – This is the start of a stretch of four holes with three par 5s and one par 3. The hole is 500 from the tips, but it still is reachable for longer hitters. The green was another beauty with a big false front and sides that spill into bunkers.

This also goes down as one of my favorite halfway houses in golf. Waves crash 30 yards beyond the building (see photo at beginning of review) and there is a set of cards at the table for anyone who wants to pop out for a light bite and soak in the surroundings… You know where you’d find me!

Hole #14 – 129 yards – Despite disappointing light for this photo, I hope the beauty of this par 3 comes through! The green looks small and sloping from the tee, but there is more square footage than you’d think. This hole immediately climbs to one of my favorite par 3s that I’ve played.

Hole #15 – 481 yards (par 5) – There is more room on the left side of this fairway than you’d think, and you can make out the pin directly down the sand path. This is another reachable par 5 and Coore & Crenshaw added new bunkers and re-edged existing traps. This hole marks a departure from the dunes section of the course heading back to the lake area and clubhouse.

Hole #16 – 470 yards (par 5) – I wish that I had taken a photo from this tee, which requires a shot over water to reach the corner of the dogleg, seen below. It is the final of the three par 5s on the back and the massive green means two-putts are not guaranteed.

Hole #17 – 287 yards – Don’t discount this hole for its length! A 230-yard shot at the second fairway bunker is perfect and it leaves a wedge into this small and sloping green – one of the best on the course.

Hole #18 – 367 yards – For those people who say the first and last are weak, we disagree again. The bunkering on this hole was drastically improved during the renovation, and believe it or not, the stunning ocean view beyond the green used to be blocked by trees. Those were removed to open up the vista and two new bunkers were added on the left to better define the fairway.

I loved the experience at Maidstone. Everyone was incredibly friendly and our host and his wife could not have been more generous. To top it all off, our caddie turned out to be someone who worked at Kingsbarns when I caddied at the course in Scotland. We knew all of the same people and figured we must have met at some point before in passing. Small world…

After the round I threw on a bathing suit and headed down to the Maidstone Beach Club where we had lunch and talked Scottish golf. Then it was down to the beach for some rest and relaxation on the beautiful stretch of coastline. If only every round of golf were capped off this way! 

Avid readers of the site will have heard me say this, but as I travel more, I give less and less credence to the top 100 lists published by magazines. I judge a day based on how much I enjoyed the design, the people, and the club as a whole. On that scale, Maidstone lands very near the top."
59,Bethpage (Black),top100,"Farmingdale, NY",A.W. Tillinghast,1935,BETHPAGE BLACK REVIEW,Graylyl Loomis,rev059_bethpage_black_1,"I played two rounds on back-to-back days on the Black course at Bethpage State Park. The course was built in 1936 by A.W. Tillinghast and, since its inception, it has hosted two U.S. Open Championships (2002, 2009) among a slew of other tournaments. Tillinghast built the course to compete with its fellow northeast neighbors (read Pine Valley and Winged Foot), and he certainly succeeded.
I played both windy rounds from the tips, measuring a long 7,400 yards. I can comfortably say that Bethpage Black is the hardest course I have ever played. Although the course was extremely difficult, it was enjoyable, and the design was fair. This quote from Golf Club Atlas sums it up well:
“Some modern courses lose a sense of continuity in their quest for difficulty. Such modern courses feel fragmented, as you go from one impossible hole to the next. One of the lasting appeals of Bethpage is that the holes seem to be effortlessly cut from the same fabric, with one sound hole following another.“
Two themes seen from A.W. Tillinghast throughout the round are a premium on driving and superb course bunkering. Keep an eye out for these two things in the pictures of the course.
The course really begins to take off on the second hole. The tee shot, seen in the picture above, requires a right to left ball flight followed by an uphill approach to an elevated green. A 3 wood or hybrid off the tee is the play. At 389 yards, it is the shortest par 4 on the course. Anything in the rough, anywhere on the course, was dead.IMG_5263
The third hole is the first real taste of Tillinghast’s amazing bunkering. The 230 yard par 3 has a large green that moves away and left from the player. A back left pin placement creates an unbelievably tough approach over the bunkers. 
The 5th hole is one of multiple on the course with a large diagonal bunker running across the fairway. The golfer can cut off as much as he wants to shorten the hole. Approaching from the right side of the fairway is optimal. The hole requires a cut off the tee and a draw into the elevated green. The par 5 4th hole is the course’s signature hole. The bunkering is extremely intimidating from the tee. Tillinghast is quoted as saying that the 4th hole is the best three shot par 5 in golf. The heavily bunkered green slopes away from the players, shrugging off any poorly struck approach shots.
The downhill approach to the 6th is one of the most picturesque on the course. The par 5 7th is another hole with a diagonal bunker guarding one side of the fairway. Cutting off a large portion of the bunker results in a shorter second shot into the hole, but land in the bunker, and you’re looking at bogey or worse. Classic risk and reward. IMG_5277The downhill par 3 8th measured 210 yards and is yet another stunning hole. The slope in front of the green is alarmingly steep. Any shot short will run back into the water. IMG_5302The collection of gorgeous par 3s continues with the 14th hole. Distance control is key with the approach to this green. The bunker short right is over ten feet deep. The tee shot can vary by nearly 40 yards depending on the pin position on this green.
The 15th hole is the number one handicap hole on the course. It is paramount to hit the fairway on this hole! A huge drive still leaves an uphill 145-165 yard approach to a heavily bunkered and sloping green. The 15th was one of my favorite holes on the course. The 17th is yet another extremely strong par 3. It requires a 205 yard shot into a very shallow green. The pin was far left during our first round and far right during our second round… I hit it into the front bunker both rounds…IMG_5361The 18th caps off a round that required nothing but pinpoint accuracy off the tee. The fairway narrows in the landing area and leaves a manageable 100-130 yard approach to a heavily bunkered, but large, elevated green. You let out of sigh of exhaustion and relief walking off the 18th green at Bethpage. 

The course was in extremely good condition. The greens, fairways, and rough were all very lush and carpet smooth; however, most of the bunkers were unraked and I ended up fixing 4-5 pitch marks on each green. Unfortunately, that is the nature of the beast with public golf courses receiving hundreds of rounds per day. The greens crew does a spectacular job with the course. I greatly enjoyed my rounds at Bethpage Black. In addition to Pine Valley, this was one of the only rounds where I couldn’t think of a weak hole on the course. I walked off the course exhausted each day. It gave me a huge appreciation for what the pros experience during a US Open at Bethpage. I was playing a less penal course setup, but each mistake during the round was deadly to a score and any weak aspect of a golfer’s game is immediately exposed. Simply having the stamina to play four competitive rounds from the tips at a monster of a course like Bethpage is a feat in itself."
60,Bethpage (Black),top100,"Farmingdale, NY",A.W. Tillinghast,1935,"Bethpage State Park (Black Course) (Farmingdale, New York)",Bill Satterfield,rev060_bethpage_black_2,"The first thing you should expect at Bethpage Black is a high score. This is one of the best and most challenging layouts the U.S. Open (2002 and 2009) has ever featured. I mean c'mon, this course features one of the most famous signs in golf: WARNING - The Black Course Is An Extremely Difficult Course Which We Recommend Only For Highly Skilled Golfers. If that isn't a good enough reason to know what to expect then I don't know what is. The course is one of the best parkland layouts in America and features some beautiful Tillinghast bunkers, just one water hazard, long rough, and big trees. Where the Black course lets its guard down is on the greens; as a group, they have got to be the flattest greens a Top 100 course has ever boasted. The Black Course is a special track and delivers one of the few times that Joe Public can tee it up on a U.S. Open layout.

Individual Hole Analysis
Signature Hole:  4th Hole – 517 Yard Par 5 – With the trees framing this beautiful fairway that features criss-crossing bunkers and plays uphill on this double dogleg, it is no doubt that the impressive par five 4th hole at Bethpage Black is the signature hole of the course.

4th Hole at Bethpage State Park (Black Course) (517 Yard Par 5)
Best Par 3:  8th Hole – 210 Yards – and 17th - 207 Yards - I just couldn't decide which par three was better so I am featuring them both. The downhill 8th hole boasts the only water hazard at Bethpage Black in the form of a pond that sits short of the green while a lone tree on the right grabs the golfer's eye and seems to have a gravitational pull on tee shots. The 17th hole is the most bunkered green on the course and turns the putting surface into a virtual elevated island. It is an attractive and intimidating view from the tee which makes it all the more rewarding if you can walk away with a par.

8th Hole at Bethpage State Park (Black Course) (210 Yard Par 3)
Best Par 4:  5th Hole – 478 Yards – A double dogleg par four is a fairly rare treat in golf and the 5th hole at Bethpage Black is the best example I've ever played. The fairway slopes left to right while a large bunker and trees await a tee shot that travels too far to the right. A tee shot up the left side may shorten up the hole but it also will partially block the green and require a high draw into a well protected green. It is a fantastic hole with options, risks, rewards, and beauty; all of which combine to make one fine hole.

5th Hole at Bethpage State Park (Black Course) (478 Yard Par 4)
Best Par 5:  4th Hole – 517 Yards – Many critics call this hole Tillinghast's best par five design ever and I concur. The bunkering is gorgeous and the double dogleg is reachable in two but requires a pair of fantastic shots to climb the hill and find this elevated green.

4th Hole at Bethpage State Park (Black Course) (517 Yard Par 5)
Birdie Time:  2nd Hole – 389 Yard Par 4 – While the second hole can be difficult because it plays to an elevated green, it is a sub-400 yard par four that doesn't require driver off the tee and plays to a very flat green. With a green this flat there is always a good chance of dropping a putt from long distance.

2nd Hole at Bethpage State Park (Black Course) (389 Yard Par 4)
Bogey Beware:  15th Hole – 478 Yard Par 4 – This uphill dogleg left hole is tough in every sense of the word. The hole doglegs late so there is very little distance you can cut off on this long hole that features a tight fairway and the most difficult approach on the course. The green slants hard from back-left to front right and the putting surface is virtually blind from the fairway below. If you miss the fairway and find Bethpage's notorius deep rough, just pray that bogey is all the worse it will get for you."
61,Atunyote Golf Club,non100,"Vernon, NY",Tom Fazio,2004,"Atunyote Golf Club At Turning Stone (Vernon, New York)",Bill Satterfield,rev061_atunyote_golf_club_1,"The Takeaway:  Clearly the king of the three courses at Turning Stone, Atunyote boasts private club level conditioning and facilities. While the relatively flat ground makes it difficult to create a highly engaging design, the course features one solid hole after another devoid of any gimmicks and results in a quality test. Atunyote is the kind of course you'd happily play time and time again which helps it be one of New York's best public tracks.  Grade B What to Expect:  Atunyote (pronounced ""uh-DUNE-yo"") is the most heralded layout at Turning Stone though it is located about five miles off site from the resort. The former PGA tour stop (2007-2010) produced notable winners Matt Kuchar and long baller Dustin Johnson and was also the host of the PGA Professionals Championship in 2006 and 2016. The course is characterized with generous fairways, white sand bunkers, and pristine conditioning. Much more forgiving than the Kaluhyat course, the parkland layout at Atunyote will allow you to occasionally spray a shot and still have a chance to salvage a par although there are still plenty of bunkers and the occasional water hazard that will cost you for being sporadic. The course is relatively flat and thus an easy walk for players that would elect to do that while some waterfalls and wide variety of trees adds to the visuals. The most expensive of the Turning Stone courses, a visit to Atunyote feels more like a trip to a private club with a grand entrance, complimentary access to lockers and the practice facility, and great service. Individual Hole Analysis Signature Hole:  11th Hole – 230 Yard Par 3 – Fazio delivers a stern test on the 11th with this lengthy par three over water. Leaking a ball to the right is death with a bunker catching balls coming up short and a stream drowning balls beyond the sand. The ideal play is a fade that starts at the left edge of the green and works its way over the inviting entrance to the putting surface. With water coming into play over the next few holes, do everything you can to keep your ball dry. 11th Hole at Atunyote Golf Club at Turning Stone (230 Yard Par 3) Best Par 3:  16th Hole – 177 Yards – The final par three at Atunyote plays to a well protected pear shaped green where attacking the pin in the front third will require deadly accurate work while the back third is less protected and features a much larger target. Fazio loves to doll up his closing holes so you'll find more sand around the green coupled with some flowers around the tees to bring some additional aesthetics here. 16th Hole at Atunyote Golf Club at Turning Stone (177 Yard Par 3) Best Par 4:  15th Hole – 442 Yards – One of my favorite holes simply because it rewards the player that can successfully shape their tee shot. This dogleg right features a bunker on the outside of the turn and is the perfect target for a player that can fade the ball off the tee. After successfully putting your drive into play, you are faced with an approach shot to a green that is shaped like the fairway and bends to the right away from the player. Two bunkers front the putting surface and call for an aerial shot to carry the sand and stick the green. Fazio designed Atunyote for championship caliber play with the bunker and hazard placements as well as the green contours, and the 15th is a good example that rewards strong play. Best Par 5:  12th Hole – 538 Yards – The best hole on the property is this reachable par five. A creek carves between the tee boxes before the fairway sets out on a journey towards the green with a pond flanking the right side for the entire length of the hole. A big tee shot can bring one of the three fairway bunkers into play while staying short of them will reduce your chances of getting home in two. The kidney shaped green represents the furthest right portion of the hole as the putting surface leans out in the water in a peninsula like fashion. This design requires plays to ask themselves a Clint Eastwood question, ""Do you feel lucky?"" 12th Hole at Atunyote Golf Club at Turning Stone (538 Yard Par 5) Birdie Time:  14th Hole – 385 Yard Par 4 – The only par four under 400 yards at Atunyote is the dolled up 14th that features a creek running down the left side and terminates into a waterfall and pond next to the green. While the waterfall looks completely artificial, it is nice to have some additional character considering the flat terrain that prevails at the course. Drives under 300 yards from the back tee will stay short of the lone fairway bunker on the right and leave a wedge shot into the green. This is a great chance to take dead aim at the flag and try to hit one tight. 14th Hole at Atunyote Golf Club at Turning Stone (385 Yard Par 4) Bogey Beware:  9th Hole – 469 Yard Par 4 – The closing hole of the front nine is a bear. With bunkers on both side of the driving zone, you'll have to thread your tee shot while still managing to put enough zip on it to leave a reasonable approach distance. Most players will be hitting a mid to long iron on their second shot and will have to contend with hitting it high enough to reach the raised green while managing to miss the deep bunker lurking right of the putting surface. Bailing out to the left leaves a chip from the rough back towards the bunker. Properly judging the spin can be a challenge so getting aggressive may result in more pain than relief. Taking par here deserves a nice treat at the turn while carding a bogey will put you in company with most golfers for the day. 9th Hole at Atunyote Golf Club at Turning Stone (469 Yard Par 4)
"
62,Atunyote Golf Club,non100,"Vernon, NY",Tom Fazio,2004,Atunyote Golf Course Review,The Original Golf Blogger,rev062_atunyote_golf_club_2,"Atunyote is a parklands style golf course that deserves the accolades it has received as one of the best public facilities in the United States. Atunyote currently stands at 55 on Golf Digest’s Top 100 Public Courses list and is number 64 on Golf Magazine’s list. Designed by Tom Fazio, Atunyote was the site of the PGA Tour’s Turning Stone Championship from 2007 to 2010. (On a side note, this is the third PGA Tour venue I have played. The others were Colonial and Torrey Pines). Atunyote is one of three 18 hole courses at the Oneida Nation’s Turning Stone Resort and Casino. A view of the Approach shot at Atunyote’s fourth. Fazio’s design is relatively straightforward. What you see is, for the most part, what you get. Strategy and lines are fairly clear to the thinking golfer from the tee and there are no hidden surprises. Atunyote’s fairways are wide but undulating. Fairways curved gracefully left and right, but there were only a handful that could really be described as doglegs. While there were few club-shifting elevation changes, the entire course was constructed on gently rolling terrain. Some sixty bunkers dot the course, but aside from the greenside hazards, few pose a real threat to a player who plans appropriately (emphasis on planning). Aside from the par threes, none of the holes require a threatening carry. In all, it’s a generally friendly course. I can’t imagine anyone cursing Fazio’s name during a round. The difficulty really lies in its length. Stretching to 7.315 from the tips and playing a strong 6,561 even from the whites, Atunyote asks for consistently strong shots from tee to green. The back tees play to a 75.8/143; The middle, 71.7/134. The fourteenth at Atunyote is a 385 yard par 4 My favorite hole was the 385 yard par 4 fourteenth (351 from the middle). Playing uphill, it has a creek along the entire left side, and a bunker at 250 out on the right. The green is set on a plateau behind a rocky waterfall. A well played tee shot heads left just short of the bunker, which then offers a clear shot into the green, avoiding the need to lob a shot in over the waterfall. My tee shot was not well played, though. The ball leaked left, putting me near a rock by the creek. I had to play out right, then pitch up to the green. The ninth at Atunyote is a 468 yard par 4 Another great hole was the 468 yard par 4 ninth (418 from the middle). The tee shot forces a player to squeeze between bunkers left and right. From there, it’s an uphill shot to a plateaued green. What makes the hole interesting is that Fazio’s design makes it look longer than it really is. Turning Stone pro Robert Todd, with whom I was playing, told us to avoid looking at the card or sign as we approached the tee. He then had us guess whether the ninth was a par four, or a five. I guessed correctly, because it was clear to me that there was just a single landing zone; a par five would have had two target areas. The two other players in the group thought it was a par five. A view of the clubhouse from the twelfth fairway. Conditions on the day I played were as fine as any course I have ever played. That’s a large part of what makes Atunyote so special. From the first tee, I felt a vibe, a sense that I was playing at a highly exclusive club. Atunyote is a pretty course, with lots of attention paid to details such as flower beds, cart paths and undergrowth. The care given this course is just amazing. Part of the reason that it is in such good shape is that — by design — Atunyote gets relatively little play. Atunyote also has one of the most spectacular practice areas I have ever seen. There’s a standard driving range, but there’s also an area that lets you practice shots from uneven lies and from a “fairway bunker.’ The short game area has stations for practicing from various distances. It was simply amazing. Pay attention to the tee signs and yardage book as you play. Each hole is named for a native bird species, and a short description of its habits and habitat are provided. The eighteenth is the Bald Eagle, or Atunyote in the Oneida language. There was just something magical, surreal, otherworldly, about Atunyote that I’ve felt on few other courses — Forest Dunes, perhaps, or Arcadia Bluffs. I don’t know how to explain it. But it’s something that I would love to feel again. Atunyote is part of the Turning Stone Resort and Casino, a terrific entertainment complex located just north of Syracuse, New York. It is one of three eighteen hole courses on the property. Two of the courses, Kaluhyat and Shenendoah are directly adjacent to the casino. Atunyote is a short ride away. The resort has eleven restaurants, twelve nightlife and lounge spots, three spas and fitness centers, and a theatre which brings in top talent. There are 268 rooms in the hotel and more in the adjacent “Lodge.” I stayed at the Lodge in a 550 square foot suite. Amazing. Every meal I ate at Turning Stone was excellent, as were the drinks. The staff from the front door of the hotel to the “cart girl” on the course were uniformly friendly and helpful. This would be a great place to take your significant other for a weekend excursion. Of course, the Resort makes its money with gambling. I’ve never been to Las Vegas, so I can’t compare Turning Stone to that, but I can say that it is exponentially more impressive than other Indian casinos I’ve visited."
63,Poppy Hills Golf Course,non100,"Pebble Beach, CA",Robert Trent Jones Jr.,1986,Updated Course Review: Poppy Hills Golf Course,Bogeys Across America,rev063_poppy_hills_1,"I’ve been looking for an excuse to come back and play the “new” version of Poppy Hills since it reopened from its major renovation in 2014. I made a point to play it not too long before it closed. You can read that review from the summer of 2012 here. Pictures were tough that day because of heavy morning fog, but it will show some differences in the course presentation. I finally had the chance to return last Friday afternoon. I had a 3:00 twilight time. I was paired with another single and we were both walking. Cart rates are very expensive here and the course is now cart path only like the Pebble Beach Resort courses (Poppy is not part of the resort, though). This course is hilly and a tough walk, but I’ve always opted to walk at all these courses anyway. It just seems better to enjoy the beautiful surroundings. We went off right behind a group of 12 (three foursomes). They were all goofing around in some sort of friendly competition, so they were not playing fast. One of the groups was really slow. Our round took about 4 hours and 50 minutes. A lot of the renovation at Poppy Hills was spurred by a desire to use less water to maintain the course while also improving drainage, inspired largely by what they did on the Pinehurst No. 2 course before the last U.S. Open that was held there. Original designer, Robert Trent Jones, Jr. and his team worked closely with the NCGA to reimagine the course and make the following changes. This list is pulled directly from the Poppy Hills website. Sand cap the entire golf course to improve drainage and foster firm, fast and fun conditions year-round. Eradicate rough, promoting imaginative shot making both through the air and on  the ground Renovate all teeing areas and relocate bunkers. Re-design, rebuild and reseed all green complexes with bentgrass and softer contours. Widen fairways and reduce angles of doglegs. Soften contours to help the course sit more naturally into the site. Add naturalized waste areas and pine straw throughout the course, bringing the forest more into focus while reducing irrigated turf from 82 acres to 62. Reveal a natural creek that was buried during original construction. Alter the yardages of par 3s to create more flexibility for setup. Indeed, it was quite a project and most reviews of the renovated course I have read have been very positive. I was a little reluctant myself because I really loved the old course. It was very difficult with tighter doglegs, hilly terrain, nasty bunkers and insane greens. I was afraid they would alter it too much. Honestly, three of those four things I listed still apply. The only thing I really noticed was that the wider fairways definitely softened up some of the sharp doglegs from before. Some trees were removed and obviously there is no more rough other than some small collars on the far edges of fairways and around bunkers. Positioning is still crucial on almost every hole, but there’s a little more room to work with than before. Otherwise, I actually might argue that the current course (at least as it played for me on Friday) is more difficult than before. This has to do largely with the newer turf that plays very firm. It is meant to be firmer and faster than the soft, fluffy grass they had before. However, it is still fairly new turf that will take quite a few years to fully mature, so I think it will soften up a little over time and ultimately improve the playability of the course. The wide, hilly and firm fairways now provide extra roll-out on drives, but that’s not always a good thing as the ball naturally feeds toward the low spots. Those low spots are generally inhabited by deep fairway bunkers, waste areas, beauty bark/pine straw or hazards. Sometimes that extra yardage helps and sometimes it doesn’t. The toughest aspect of the course right now is the greens. They are incredibly firm. Unless you get pro-level spin on your approach shots, they won’t hold much. I was joking that I might be able to stop a wet hacky sack from 10 yards with a 64-degree wedge, but that’s about it. The greens were big and undulated before and the newly shaped greens are just as intense. With the firmness of the surfaces, the idea now is to force more links strategy and allow for more run-up shots where you can play the contours. You would have to play this course a lot to figure out all the right strategies and slopes for each green. At the same time, there are many false fronts and the ball doesn’t always release like you’d want and expect from a links course. It’s tough to judge even the shortest of shots and it really gets in your head. Through the course of my round, I got away with a couple bad shots that ended up good. Overall, though, I’d say I hit many more shots that I thought were good, but ended up in trouble. On the first hole, I had a short pitch (maybe 40 yards). I landed it on the front third of the green and it catapulted all the way off the back edge and down into a hazard. The green was so firm and there was no rough behind the green to stop it. That one shot messed my head up for the entire round! You have to be able to adjust your thinking and execute different types of shots around Poppy Hills. Some people will appreciate that and others might be frustrated by it. I fall somewhere in between. Aesthetically, I like some of what they did around the course with the new waste areas and redone bunkers. They didn’t take away from the natural beauty of the original course running through the hills and trees. Some holes are framed very nicely now, especially on the back nine. I thought the back nine definitely looked more appropriate with this rather rugged design style than much of the front nine, which I think looked better before with more lush, green grass covering the course from edge to edge. Parts of the back nine, including the new 11th hole, really reminded me of Bandon Trails and I liked that. After the renovation, they did really jack up the rates at Poppy Hills. It used to be somewhat reasonably priced in comparison to the resort courses, but now it will cost out-of-towners a pretty penny to tee it up here. NCGA members do get a lot of discounts and deals here, so it will draw plenty of regular local play. Poppy Hills doesn’t quite have the prestige of the Pebble Beach Resort courses, nor does it have the oceanfront views, so I don’t know if the new pricing will work against them when trying to attract destination golfers on their dream Pebble Beach trips. They seem to be doing just fine with it, though, so I don’t imagine the prices will come back down any time soon. Maybe they’ll reintroduce an intermediate SCGA member discount like they once had, so at least all Californians can take advantage. Either way, I think Poppy Hills is still an awesome course on every level. Personally, I would probably say I liked it better before the renovation, but I may be in the minority. Anyone who comes out and plays the new version of the course will likely not be disappointed. The natural beauty is still inspiring. The layout is very difficult, yet enjoyable. The great feeling you get when walking the inspiring landscape of Pebble Beach will never get old."
64,Poppy Hills Golf Course,non100,"Pebble Beach, CA",Robert Trent Jones Jr.,1986,Poppy Hills,Bill Satterfield,rev064_poppy_hills_2,"The Takeaway:  Poppy Hills is vastly improved since the renovation with firm and fast conditions, no rough, and great putting contours on bentgrass greens. The course feels more natural than before and while it will never compete with Pebble Beach's incredible coastal setting, Poppy Hills' successful renovation makes it pleasure to play and a great value for NCGA members.  Grade B. What to Expect:  Poppy Hills represents the first course owned and operated by an amateur golf association (Northern California Golf Association) and utilizes the course as its headquarters. The course underwent an extensive renovation that improved both the layout and conditions. Formerly nicknamed ""Sloppy Poppy"" by some of its critics, there is nothing sloppy about the new and improved Poppy Hills that plays firm and fast from tee to green thanks to a new drainage system, a new 5 A sandy base, and a more efficient sprinkler system. The bunkering is improved and lays more naturally on the land which is a welcome sight. The artificial mounds throughout the course have been eliminated which improves the look and drainage. Every green on the course was redone which included softening some contours and improving the areas leading up to the putting surface so that they would be receptive in the firm and fast conditions. In fact, attacking some pin positions is best done by landing off the green and then using the surrounding undulations to feed the ball towards the hole. An improvement that everyone will enjoy is the transformation to bentgrass greens which gives Poppy Hills perhaps the best putting surfaces in the famed Monterey area. The elimination of the doglegs and the rough provide a much more player friendly, and frankly more fun, layout then Poppy Hills experienced in the past. The rough around the trees that frame the holes has been replaced with pine straw which is much easier to play from and find a ball in. The nines have also been reversed from the original layout and some glimpses of the ocean are more readily available today. Members of the NCGA pay one-third of what the general public pays and even being accompanied by a NCGA member will cut your green fee in half. Members of the NCGA would be fools to not play the improved Poppy with rates under $100. The old Poppy Hills was forgettable, artificial, and a punchline but now stands as the best value on 17-mile drive. Individual Hole Analysis. Signature Hole:  18th Hole – 519 Yard Par 5 – The closing hole at Poppy provides an exciting finish and great risk/reward opportunity. At just 519 yards from the tips, this par five will be reachable for many players with a well struck drive. The approach shot plays to a greensite fronted by a hazard that is partially waste area and partially a creek and marked with yellow stakes. The safe play calls for a ball brought in from the right side where a hill that slopes towards the green will feed balls onto the putting surface and set up a potential eagle putt. Attacking a pin in the back left of the green is the riskiest play on this hole as there is less green to work with and a longer carry over the hazard. 18th Hole at Poppy Hills Golf Course (519 Yard Par 5). Best Par 3:  6th Hole – 200 Yards – With the ocean glistening in the background beyond the trees, a beautiful stage is set for the tee shot to this Redan green. The safe line up the right side will allow for balls to feed left, so only aim towards the left half of the green if you are totally dialed into your game. With the firm greens at Poppy, utilizing the slopes and contours can be more beneficial than trying to fly the ball towards the flag. 6th Hole at Poppy Hills Golf Course (200 Yard Par 3). Best Par 4:  14th Hole – 439 Yards – The beautiful 14th hole had some trees thinned out to expose the ocean straight ahead on this dogleg left. A draw that wraps around the tree framing the left side of the hole with quickly shorten the distance and set up a great angle for the approach shot. With bunkers on the far side of the fairway there is nothing wrong with banging a 3-wood down the middle and taking a little longer approach shot but ensuring it is done from the fairway. 14th Hole at Poppy Hills Golf Course (439 Yard Par 4). Best Par 5:  1st Hole – 514 Yards – The former 10th hole is now the opener at Poppy and it is a dandy. A huge slope frames the right side of the hole and will generously kick your slice back towards the middle of the fairway. The approach shot plays downhill to a raised green that is protected on the left side by a pond and in the center by a bunker. The sloping edges off the green present a quick introduction to the benefits of learning to bump and run the ball rather than fly it to your final destination. With a generous fairway and relatively short distance, Poppy wants you to start things off with an easy par or even a bird. 1st Hole at Poppy Hills Golf Course (514 Yard Par 5). Birdie Time:  9th Hole – 503 Yard Par 5 – At just over 500 yards this par five presents a great opportunity to reach in two. The bold play challenges the bunker on the left with a power draw that quickly shortens the hole and probably places a long or mid iron in your hands for attacking the green with. The long green presents a variety of pin placements that varies the difficulty of the hole yielding one putt eagles as quickly as three putt bogeys. 9th Hole at Poppy Hills Golf Course (503 Yard Par 5)
Bogey Beware:  7th Hole – 430 Yard Par 4 – While not punishing in length, the steady uphill nature of this hole makes it play deceptively long. After maneuvering around the bend on the right, the approach shot plays to a green fronted by a large bunker that is quick to gobble up shots that don't have the merit to carry all the way onto the putting surface. This hole plays harder than it looks and before you know it you've played a box around your score and slumped off with a bogey."
65,Galloway National Golf Club,non100,"Absecon, NJ",Tom Fazio,1995,"Galloway National Golf Club (Absecon, New Jersey)",Bill Satterfield,rev065_galloway_1,"What to Expect:  Galloway National is one of Tom Fazio’s Top 100 courses located outside of Atlantic City. The course is relatively flat and located on sandy soil in dense pine forest. Several water hazards come into play and views of the Atlantic City skyline are afforded on some of the holes. Like all Fazio courses, Galloway National features impressive bunkering, comfortable fairway widths, and fun greens. The club encourages taking a caddy and going for a walk, but carts are available as well. Individual Hole Analysis Signature Hole:  2nd Hole – 152 Yard Par 3 – With Atlantic City in the distance to the right and a marsh covering the ground between the tee box and the green, this hole visually is an impressive sight. A bunker fronts the green while a boomerang bunker flanks the left side of the hole but manages to leave a bail out area short and right. Inside the back portion of the boomerang bunker, a pine tree was planted to form a double hazard. Short and sweet at about 150 yards, this hole is an attention grabber and a great way to get things rolling early on in the round. 2nd Hole at Galloway National Golf Club (152 Yard Par 3) Best Par 3:  17th Hole – 253 Yards – Galloway National’s final par three offer one last view of Atlantic City that frames the background of the green. Plenty of room is offered short of the green on this long one-shotter that features a large bunker up the left side with a pair of trees perched in the sand. It is another impressive offering in the long list of late round par 3s that Tom Fazio has designed over the years. 17th Hole at Galloway National Golf Club (253 Yard Par 3) Best Par 4: Best Par 5:  16th Hole – 584 Yards – Fazio decided to have some fun with the par five 16th hole by shaping the fairway to look like the state of New Jersey, but the forest acts as the ocean in this reenactment while a water hazard represent Pennsylvania. A bunker climbs out of the top of the water hazard and creeps up to the front left part of the green and around a portion of the side. Visually it is a remarkable hole, and strategically it is compelling. 16th Hole at Galloway National Golf Club (584 Yard Par 5) Birdie Time:  11th Hole – 513 Yard Par 5 – Reachable par fives are great chances to card a birdie and such an opportunity is afforded at Galloway National’s 11th hole. A large bunker with a pair of fescue islands found within, engulfs the right side of the fairway about 150 yards from the green. But since this intimidating bunker is 350 yards away, it won’t come into play under most circumstances and can be avoided relatively easily when attacking this green in two. A trio of bunkers protect the green while a front the putting surface and drowns approaches hit short and left. Play to the strengths of your game and go grab a birdie! Bogey Beware:  13th Hole – 474 Yard Par 4 – This lengthy par four is plenty challenging in terms of pure yardage to cover, but factor in the 100 yard long bunker up the right side of the hole and you may have bitten off more than you can chew. Relatively straight from tee to green, there is no yardage that can be cut off on this hole. A pair of bunkers pinch the front tongue portion of the green while the back part of the green widens up considerably. In the end, this is a long hole with a ton of sand to contend with; good luck!"
66,Galloway National Golf Club,non100,"Absecon, NJ",Tom Fazio,1995,Review: Galloway National Golf Club,Worldgolfer,rev066_galloway_2,"History: Galloway National is the vision of Vernon Hill, a local multi-millionaire and founder of Commerce Bank. The official story is that Hill and his buddies were tired of slow rounds on the public Jersey Shore courses, but rumors have it Galloway was Hill’s solution for not getting into Pine Valley. With a blank check in hand, architect Tom Fazio fell in love with the waterfront property and exclaimed, “Galloway National will be one of my best courses.” soon after completing the design in 1994. Golf publications agree, and the Club holds the following accolades: Conditions: 10/10, Like most Fazio courses, Galloway National is in trememdous shape with smooth Creeping Bentgrass greens and lush rough and fairways. The bunkers (of which there are many) are also fantastic. Hole Descriptions: Architect Tom Fazio is a rather divisive figure in the architecture community. On the surface, his success is impressive, and at one point he had the most Top 100 courses of any architect. Critics, however, argue that his courses are predictable and rely on aesthetic appeal and conditioning in lieu of actual substance. After playing 140+ courses (mainly in the Northeast where Fazio is not very active), Galloway National would finally be my first Fazio. It’s hard to make a judgment after seeing just one course (especially one of his best), but I was extremely impressed by Galloway National. The course is in perfect condition and is extremely beautiful sitting directly on Reeds Bay with the Atlantic City skyline featured prominently on many holes. There are numerous sandy wastebunkers that give a Pine Valley feel and the pine tree-lined back 9 reminds me a lot of the Pinehurst area courses. I understand the criticism and doubt Fazio will ever create a course novel enough to crack the top 20, but his recipe is certainly good enough to produce many top 200 courses. I look forward to playing more of his courses in the near future. The opening hole is one of my favorites of a very strong set of par fours. At 375 yards, this sleek dogleg right features an immediate forced carry of 150 yards over wasteland to a fairway that turns right at about 230 yards. A bunker lines the left at 240 yards, while those that attempt to cut the corner will have to carry a giant wastebunker that runs from 200 yards all the way to the green. This green is narrow, slopes back-to-front with two tiers, and is guarded by deep bunkers short on either side. I’ve been told this hole pays homage to another great 1st hole in New Jersey, but I haven’t had the pleasure of making that comparison firsthand… Options abound on the opening teeshot at Galloway National The approach at the 1st plays directly towards the water. A memorable green complex caps off a fantastic starting hole. After just one dogleg, you’re already on the marshes and the 2nd hole takes full advantage as an 151 yard all-carry par 3. The carry is exhilarating but the most interesting aspect of this hole is the green, which is giant and plays as a Biarritz with a middle swoon and severely back-to-front sloped back portion. Missing this green in any direction is absolutely devastating with a bunker short, marshes right and long, and a steep embankment left that leaves a brutal up-and-down. This is just one of several world-class one-shotters at Galloway National. The memorable par 3 2nd.Don’t let the spectacular views distract you from this dangerous green If there’s a weakness of Galloway, it’s that there isn’t a great short par 4. At 345 yards, the 3rd hole is the shortest par 4 but is probably the most forgettable hole on the course. Playing straightaway and slightly uphill, this tree-lined par 4 isn’t truly reachable and a giant wastebunker down the left at 245 yards makes driver the wrong play. This large, undulating green slopes primarily back-to-front with a a bunker short. The par 4 3rd. The 4th hole is a stellar 437 yard dogleg left with a teeshot through a tight chute to a generous fairway. The dogleg doesn’t occur until about 240 yards here, so golfers will need some distance to avoid being blocked out on their second shot. From the teebox, it appears as if you should cut the corner over a giant wastebunker down the left, but this is actually not a smart play as the landing area is essentially nothing past this bunker. This approach plays over a valley of fairway to a large, reverse redan green complex guarded by a bunker right. The challenging par 4 4th. The approach at 4 from behind the giant wastebunker
Apparently Fazio intended to make the 5th hole a short par 4 but wasn’t able to for environmental reasons. Instead, the 5th is another par 3 that plays over marshland the entire way. While not as special as the 2nd, the views are again spectacular and appreciated here. Bunkers guard left and short of a back-to-front sloped green with a swale on the left. The beautiful par 3 5th. A closer look at the 5th green. At 531 yards, par 5 6th is the longest hole at Galloway National. This long, straightaway three-shotter is seemingly inspired by Pine Valley with a sandy wastebunker immediately in front of the teebox running 315 yards down the left. Another long crossbunker lines the left side of the lay-up area while a smaller one lines just short right of a large elevated green. If one can keep it straight, this becomes one of the easier holes on the course. The sandy par 5 6th. The par 4 7th hole is another that evokes feelings of Pine Valley at a strong 393 yards. With an immediate 170 yard forced carry over fescue, this hole features a tight fairway lined by thick forest down the right and a pond with fescue down the left. A tall tree down the left at about 275 yards forces the golfer to the right, where they’ll have to contend with a crossbunker at 275 yards. This approach is absolutely stunning to an elevated green guarded by a moat of jagged bunker short. The excellent par 4 7th.  I absolutely love the bunkering surrounding the 7th green. At 179 yards, the 8th hole is a classic par 3 over water to a wide green guarded by a bunker long right. This hole wouldn’t normally stand out on level terrain but Fazio did an excellent job and gave the green redan-like characteristics that make it memorable. The par 3 8th. The closing hole on the front 9 is my favorite par 5 on the course at a strong 515 yards. Like the 6th, this teeshot is semi-blind over a giant sandy wasteland. There’s more room to the right than it appears, but you must carry at least 200 yards to clear the bunker on this side. From the fairway, this hole bends slightly right with a patch of rough separating another portion of fairway for the final 160 yards. This slightly elevated green is reachable in theory but a small tree down the right forces the golfer to play a fade if he/she wants to reach from the right side of the fairway. Deep bunkers surround this green that slopes generously back left-to-front right. The semi-blind teeshot at 9. The 2nd shot at 9 with the modern clubhouse in the background. Galloway National has a reputation as a very difficult course, but you don’t really feel it on the front 9. The back 9, however, is a real challenge, playing over 400 yards longer with tighter fairways and more water hazards. The 421 yard 10th is indeed a challenging hole as a tight, straightaway par 4 with an immediate 130 yard forced carry over water. Large bunkers guard the right at 240 yards and 330 yards with another large bunker short left of the green. The most interesting aspect of this hole is the green, which plays as a dual redan with most balls funneling towards the center. The long par 4 10th. At 508 yards, the 11th hole is the shortest par 5 at Galloway National and one that gives the golfer plenty of options. The teeshot, however, is rather straightforward to a straightaway fairway lined by thick forests on both sides and a long waste bunker down the left for the first 220 yards. At 310 yards, the fairway narrows to almost nothing with giant bunkers on both sides. On the second shot, the golfer has the option of going for the shallow green, which juts out over water on the left or hitting it right to a severely right-to-left sloping fairway with an interesting knob of rough in the middle. This back-to-front sloped green is surrounded by trouble with water and a false front short and bunkers surrounding the other three sides. The par 5 11th. Do you go for glory on 11 or play it safely down the right? The 12th hole is by far the shortest par 4 on the back 9 at 363 yards, but doesn’t necessarily play easy with a tight fairway and sharp dogleg left at 250 yards. Longer hitters who can hook the ball can theoretically cut the corner, but trees down the left the entire way and a bunker at the inside corner of the dogleg make this a risky endeavor. This approach plays slightly uphill to a redan green guarded by bunkers short and left. The dogleg left 12th. The approach at 12. At 453 yards, the 13th hole is the longest par 4 on the course and a deserving number 1 handicap. This uphill, straightaway hole is intimidating off the tee with a chute of thick forests to traverse and a tight fairway lined by a giant and beautiful bunker right. This approach plays at least one club extra to a large, severely back-to-front sloped green guarded by bunkers on either side. A par here gains a shot on the field. The beastly par 4 13th. The 14th hole is the first of two excellent long par threes on the back at 203 yards. This gorgeous hole plays slightly downhill over a giant wastebunker that runs through the right side of the green. The green here is very large and slopes hard left-to-right with multiple plateaus. The par 3 14th. The 15th hole is one of my favorite holes at Galloway and marks the beginning of a fantastic final stretch. At 409 yards, this strong par 4 features an immediate 135 yard carry over water and fescue to a tight tree-lined fairway. This hole is most notable for its Hell’s half acre-inspired bunker at 285 yards that occludes much of the fairway. From here, the hole turns slightly left to a redan green lined by a deep left bunker. The strong par 4 15th. Fazio’s bunkering at 15 is absolute golf porn. The par fives at Galloway National are generally scoreable, but the 525 yard 16th hole is the most difficult of the group. This hole has been described as gimmicky by many due to its fairway shaped like New Jersey, but thankfully New Jersey has a somewhat indistinct shape and you wouldn’t necessarily know unless told. The teeshot here is quite intimidating with a long forced carry over a wastebunker, water down the left starting at 215 yards, and thick forest lining the right the entire way. This lay-up is fairly challenging as well as the fairway snakes left with trees jutting into the right and a snake-like bunker down the left. After what seems like a marathon, an undulating, elevated green awaits guarded by deep bunkers short and left. If the water hazard is “Pennsylvania” and the right trees are the “Atlantic Ocean,” then my poor drive landed somewhere near Atlantic City
The 17th hole is somewhat of a signature hole for Galloway National and is probably the most visually appealing hole on a course full of beauty. At 231 yards, this is a beast of a par 3 that plays slightly easier due to the fact that it plays downhill with ample bailout room short. This teeshot must traverse numerous wastebunkers to reach a large back-to-front sloped green. The Atlantic City skyline is seen prominently through a window of trees behind this green. The signature par 3 17th. With Atlantic City and the Bay at your back, the closing hole is fittingly epic as a 428 dogleg right. This teeshot demands an immediate 160 yard carry over marshland to reach a wide fairway that slides hard right at 250 yards. Giant bunkers line both sides of the fairway for much of the landing zone and the approach must also carry a giant wastebunker. This large, undulating green is partially hidden behind the wastebunker and is lined by another bunker right. The closing teeshot. The approach at 18. General Comments: Galloway’s practice facilities are extremely strong with a giant grass range and short game area near the 1st tee. The clubhouse is large and spacious, but is a bit too modern for my liking. There were only a few groups on the course the day I played and I got the impression the course is never too busy. Like nearby Seaview, Galloway has a real problem with green-headed flies so make sure to wear longer clothes. Galloway’s gorgeous driving range. Verdict: Beautiful, difficult, and in immaculate condition, the underrated Galloway National is an example of Tom Fazio at his absolute best. Fazio marries sandy wastebunkers, tall pines, and the Atlantic City skyline to create numerous fantastic holes and the look and feel of places like Pine Valley and Pinehurst. This is the best course in the loaded Atlantic City area and one of the best in the golf-rich state of New Jersey."
67,Dunes Golf and Beach Club,non100,"Myrtle Beach, SC",Robert Trent Jones Sr.,1948,Dunes Golf & Beach Club,top100golfcourses,rev067_dunes_golf_beach_1,"The Myrtle Beach area, known as the “Grand Strand”, is a 70-mile coastal strip of golfing and vacation heaven stretching from Pawleys Island in the south to Brunswick County in the north. Boasting more than 100 golf courses of many styles and price ranges, it is a difficult task to choose the top course on the Strand. However, since its opening in 1948 when the Robert Trent Jones Snr layout was only the second course on the Strand, the Dunes Golf & Beach Club has been at or near the top of every Myrtle Beach golf course list. The Dunes has hosted the Ladies US Open (in 1962) and the PGA Tour “Q-school.” Although located barely more than a block from the beach and with most holes subject to strong ocean breezes, the style of the course is not seaside or links by any stretch of the imagination. It has woodland, parkland and marshland elements, with the 9th being the only hole where a player catches a glimpse of the Atlantic. Most holes are lined with beautiful old oaks and water comes into play by way of ponds and marshes on more than half the holes. The mostly elevated green complexes are extremely challenging as a result of large and deep Augusta white sand bunkers. Other RTJ trademarks are the runway tee boxes and a generous dose of strategic fairway bunkering, requiring well placed tee shots. Typical of the Jones design philosophy, for the good golfer there are risk-reward options on most holes that can mean easy par if you choose the safer option and difficult birdie – with a risk of much worse – if you choose the riskier option (or for the high handicapper, easy bogey/difficult par.) The 13th hole, known as Waterloo, is a 590-yard par five in a crescent moon shape along the perimeter of Lake Singleton. A slice or push off the tee (for a right handed golfer) is wet. Any thought of going for the green in two requires a very long tee shot. However, the longer the tee shot, the narrower the fairway becomes. On the other hand, the more conservative the tee shot, the longer the remaining shots will be. Even with a moderately good tee shot, the player is then challenged to cut off as much of the lake as he dares. Bite off more than you can chew and you’re wet. Meet the challenge and a possible birdie awaits. The course has four outstanding par threes, among them the 12th hole which is all carry over a salt-water marsh. The finishing hole is a beautiful long par four with a green fronted by a pond. On either of these holes a front pin position makes firing at the flag a particularly risky choice. Since early in the new millennium the club has had Rees Jones and his associate Steve Weisser working alongside long-term superintendent Steve Hamilton on course improvements. Greens have been brought back to their original size, new tees introduced and a state-of-the-art irrigation system installed. Bunkers have also been reviewed, with Better Billy Bunker liner installed throughout. “Every bunker has been rethought and relocated or rebuilt,” said Rees Jones. “We also carefully evaluated the depths of the bunkers. We’ve taken some fill away and cut them down into the surface.” The public may play the Dunes only if booked into a limited number of Myrtle Beach accommodations, so plan your trip accordingly. While there you must also play Caledonia Golf & Fish Club located about a 30-minute drive to the South. Figuring out which of the remaining 100 or so courses to play after that will be a fun challenge."
68,Dunes Golf and Beach Club,non100,"Myrtle Beach, SC",Robert Trent Jones Sr.,1948,"Dunes Golf And Beach Club (Myrtle Beach, South Carolina)",Bill Satterfield,rev068_dunes_golf_beach_2,"The Takeaway:  The Dunes Golf and Beach Club makes a strong argument as the best course in Myrtle Beach. The conditioning is excellent and the parkland setting just feels different than many of the upper end courses in the area. While it would have been nice to have more ocean views from the course, the 19th hole provides a front row seat to the Atlantic. The course design is varied and there is little to not like about Dunes.  Grade B+. What to Expect:  The Dunes Golf and Beach Club is often referenced as the finest course in Myrtle Beach which is an impressive designation considering the 100+ courses to contend with. The clubhouse boasts a seaside location with impressive views of the ocean waves crashing into the shore. The conditions are quite plush and the course has more of a parkland feel than the dunes/links feel that I was expecting. There are gentle contours found throughout the course and several water hazards. In fact, as we approached the signature hole, I was a bit taken back by the “Beware of Alligators” sign that prominently sits next to the tee box; something you would never see back home in Idaho! Overall, the course was a pure joy to play with solid golf holes from start to finish and one of the best locations to enjoy the 19th hole. Individual Hole Analysis
Signature Hole:  13th Hole – 590 Yard Par 5 – Not only the signature hole of the course, but perhaps the signature hole of Myrtle Beach, this famous par five is as difficult as it is memorable. This dogleg right bends around Singleton Lake with the water jetting out and tightening the fairway at various places, none tighter than where the hole takes its sharpest turn right. The approach shot plays uphill to a well bunkered green which makes reaching the green in two an unlikely proposition. With alligators looming in the lake as a reminder of all of the trouble on this hole, the 13th is perhaps the finest three-shorter in South Carolina. 13th Hole at Dunes Golf and Beach Club (590 Yard Par 5). Best Par 3:  9th Hole – 200 Yards – This postcard par three boasts palm trees sprinkled across the landscape and waves from the Atlantic Ocean rolling into the beach in the background. The elevated green combined with the prevailing wind in your face make hitting this green in regulation no easy task. Factor in some white sand bunkers and this hole is as much beauty as it is beast. 9th Hole at Dunes Golf and Beach Club (200 Yard Par 3). Best Par 4:  11th Hole – 430 Yards – The 11th hole plays along the marsh known as Singleton Swash and should have golfers thinking about hitting it anywhere except right. Trees provide a buffer between the fairway and the marsh prior to the fairway turning 90 degrees to the right and the green being fronted by water. The hole is long enough and the approach shot demanding enough that it is tough to justify playing too safely off the tee, but this hole certainly rewards accuracy more than length. 11th Hole at Dunes Golf and Beach Club (430 Yard Par 4).  Best Par 5:  13th Hole – 590 Yards – Already featured as the signature hole, this larger than life par five is well known up and down the Grand Strand. With a ""Beware of Alligators"" sign causing players to be nervous in the first place, the hole doesn't hold back as this lengthy three-shotter banks right around Singleton Lake and uphill to an undulated green protected by bunkers and sitting in an amphitheater of trees. This green sits at the northeast corner of the property with attractive views across the lake and of the coastal buildings. The wind also tends to be stronger moving across the lake which can affect approach shots here. 13th Hole at Dunes Golf and Beach Club (590 Yard Par 5). Birdie Time:  4th Hole – 505 Yard Par 5 – A very reachable par five greets you at the 4th hole which is a dogleg left protected on the corner by a pair of bunkers. The green is fronted by a thin creek which acts as the main defense to this vulnerable hole. If you can reach the green in two with an iron in your hand then take a rip and two putt your way to glory. If you need to lay up, you still have a great chance to convert a birdie since there is plenty of room to hit to your favorite yardage. The 4th is a great chance to get under par early in the round. 4th Hole at Dunes Golf and Beach Club (505 Yard Par 5). Bogey Beware:  12th Hole – 245 Yard Par 3 – Playing along Singleton Swash, this lengthy par three is intimidating to attack. If the wind is coming off the ocean and across the lake then players may have to consider starting their ball over the hazard in hopes that it blows back to the green. It may not be sexy, but you may want to implore Billy Casper's 1959 U.S. Open strategy where he laid up on the lengthy 3rd everyday and took par all four rounds. 12th Hole at Dunes Golf and Beach Club (245 Yard Par 3).

69,Hyannisport Club,non100,"Hyannis Port, MA","Alex Findlay, 1897/Donald Ross, 1936",1897,Hyannisport Club,John Sabino,rev069_hyannisport_1,"I am finally catching up on old posts from rounds played this past summer and highlight a low-key club that remains a prized invitation in the world of golf. The Hyannisport Club was established in 1897 in Hyannisport, Mass on Cape Cod. Hyannisport Club is not ranked in the top 100, but then again neither are many other fantastic golf clubs like Whippoorwill, Myopia Hunt Club and Piping Rock. The club is located within walking distance of the Kennedy compound in Hyannis and JFK used to play here when he was on the cape. The course has world class views of the water and the surrounding tidal marshes looking out into Nantucket Sound. The course itself was designed by Alex Findlay in 1901. Findlay was born to Scottish parents while on board a ship coming in America in 1865. It was re-designed by Donald Ross in 1936 and plays from a yardage of 6,348 yard from the tips. The course has a set of small, very fast greens. Many of the greens are quite narrow as well with bunkers on long side of the greens. More than once I found myself in a bunker and if you don't hit the perfect high shot you will find yourself in a bunker on the other side of the green. The course begins with a relatively straight 448 yard par four, a gentle opener. This is followed by a 265 yard par four that is also relatively easy. The third features a dogleg left that plays at an angle off the tee to a fairway set over a tidal marsh. The fourth is a 410 yard dogleg  that plays around the same body of water. The par threes on the course all feature a landing pad in front of the greens that at first slopes away from your line of play and then slopes upward. This makes the approach shots to the green very tricky because if you land your shot just a bit short and it hits on the downslope then it will likely shoot across the green. Factor in the wind and it becomes even trickier. Particularly good par threes include the 195-yard eighth, which plays into a cross-wind coming off the Sound. The fifteenth, a 177-yarder and the seventeenth, a 141-yarder play directly into the prevailing wind. All three are good golf holes. Another hole of note is the 476-yard par five sixteenth which plays through a dramatic left to right sloping hill. Your tee shot is blind as is your second over the hill. Although you will likely have a very short iron into the green, it is also highly likely that you will have a uneven lie as the terrain slopes on the entire hole from left to right. The holes along the water and marsh reminded me quite a bit of Maidstone in East Hampton, and many of the approach shots play the same way they do on the holes that border the pond at Maidstone. Aside from a couple of holes on the front that play over marshes the course has no water hazards. John Kennedy followed Eisenhower as president and the latter played over 1,000 rounds while he was President. Camelot was sensitive to this fact and positioned himself as a contrast of the old guard Republicans who played golf all the time. Thus, he would normally play with little fanfare and would sneak out without the media present. He would often play a short loop of holes at Hyannisport, the first and second followed by sixteen through eighteen, all of which are near the clubhouse. The finishing hole looks easy on the scorecard at 310 yards but it plays straight up a big hill and features a narrow tee shot. A view from above the eighteenth green overlooking Nantucket Sound and the marshes is below. One of the things that is so unique and pleasurable about golf is to be able to play where your idols have played before you. What a thrill to walk and play where JFK used to. "
70,Hyannisport Club,non100,"Hyannis Port, MA","Alex Findlay, 1897/Donald Ross, 1936",1897,Review: Hyannisport Club,Worldgolfer,rev070_hyannisport_2,"History: Hyannisport’s architectural history is a bit murky but begins in 1897 when founding member John Reid laid out a 6-hole layout for his friends. In 1902, the Club hired prolific architect Alex Findlay to build an additional 3 holes to make it a 9-hole course. Today’s 1st, 2nd, 15th, 16th, and 18th are practically conserved from this primitive course. It’s unclear when Hyannisport expanded to 18 holes, but it certainly was 18 holes after Donald Ross redesigned it in 1936. Today’s course is Ross’ with a few upgrades from Ron Forse along the way. Never in the national spotlight and immensely private, Hyannisport hosted the Massachusetts Open in 1958 and 1959 but seems unlikely to do so in the future at its short length. The Club is perhaps most famous for being home to John F. Kennedy and the Kennedy Compound is just a few hundred yards from the course. Hyannisport has earned the following awards: Conditions: 9/10, Hyannisport is in excellent condition with lush fairways, thick rough, and well-kept bunkers and teeboxes. Similar to many seaside courses, the greens here aren’t blazingly fast, but certainly roll true. Hole Descriptions: When it comes to golf on the Cape, there’s Eastward Ho! and Hyannisport and then everything else. At the time of writing this, I actually haven’t explored the Cape as much as I should’ve but I’ve been fortunate to play both Eastward and Hyannisport and it’s hard not to compare the two. Both are short, historic, seaside courses with fantastic views and an emphasis on fun when the wind isn’t howling. With that being said, I much prefer Eastward Ho! to Hyannisport for several reasons. First and foremost, the quality and depth of holes is much stronger at Eastward. While there are one, maybe two, weaker holes at the Ho!, Hyannisport features several world-class holes mainly on the water and a rather forgettable interior. The 3rd, 4th, 8th, and 16th are fantastic, but many of the other holes are simply tree-lined and straight, running parallel to each other. Donald Ross is a master router, but Hyannisport was not his best effort, perhaps because he inherited the canvas of several other architects. Hyannisport does have its merits, however. The aforementioned holes are tremendous and walking where JFK played so many rounds is a special feeling. Hyannisport is not a long course at just over 6400 yards from the Black Tees, but the opening hole is an anomaly as a 439 yard par 4. Playing straightaway downhill, the longest par 4 on the course features a generous and undulating fairway lined by rough and small trees. There are several bunkers on either side for the final 100 yards, but I’m not sure what these are protecting. This green is excellent and one of the best on the course running back-to-front with multiple tiers and deep bunkers on either side. The approach into the excellent 1st green. At just 280 yards, the 2nd hole is the shortest par 4 at Hyannisport and a rather easy hole. Although the fairway progressively narrows with numerous bunkers as you near this narrow green, it’s not enough to salvage this fairly mundane straightaway, flat hole. Apparently Ross thought the same and desired the green to be built into a hill long left, but his vision never came to fruition. A closer look at the danger surrounding the 2nd green. The next two holes are some of the finest on the course as long Cape par fours. The 3rd hole is the better of the two and my favorite hole at Hyannisport (and one of my favorite par fours anywhere)! At 395 yards, this is a hole that simply cannot be replicated with today’s modern restrictions on environmental areas. Beginning with an exhilarating teeshot over the marshes, the golfer must choose how much to bite off with a carry ranging from 100 to 210 yards depending on how far left you venture. This slab of fairway ends abruptly with more hazards about 100 yards short of the green, requiring yet another carry to find this square, rather receptive green lined by a bunker right and marshes long and left. The 4th hole is another stunner as a 410 yard dogleg left par 4. The number 1 handicap, this difficult hole features a somewhat confusing teeshot with ample room to the right that’s further from the hole. Marshland hugs the entire lefthand corner of the fairway and the golfer needs at least a 210 yard carry to have a reasonable approach. This right-to-left sloping green juts out into the marsh with a trio of bunkers guarding right and marsh long and left. A par here is well-earned. The 5th hole brings us to the first par 3 at Hyannisport at 176 yards. This was originally a par 4 from the current 4th teebox on Findlay’s 1902 course so the green is set at an awkward angle from its current teebox. Diagonal with an opening short right, this green slopes hard back-to-front with two tiers and is surrounded by four deep bunkers at its corners.  A closer look at the wicked slope at 5 The 6th hole is the first of two rather pedestrian and similar par fives on the front 9. At 520 yards, this straightaway hole initially plays uphill over a plateau with a semi-blind teeshot. Trees run down the left side the entire way while the right is more open besides a trio of bunkers between 160 and 240 yards. This lay-up is complicated by bunkers on either side and a narrowing fairway. A large, receptive green is defended by bunkers left, long, and right. The par 5 6th Be careful to avoid the numerous bunkers at 6 At 414 yards, the 7th hole runs parallel to the 6th back towards the water. This beautiful, straightaway hole plays downhill with a generous fairway lined by trees and bunkers on either side between 200 and 230 yards. The approach here is stellar with a rumpled fairway and a beautiful water backdrop. This circular green is well-defended by two bunkers right, one left, and marshland long. The beautiful par 4 7th The approach at 7 The longest and most difficult par 3 at 202 yards, the 8th hole is also my favorite of a very nice set of one-shotters at Hyannisport. Lying directly on the water on the furthest west part of the property, this flat hole is quite intimidating with an immediate 120 yard forced carry over marshland. While there’s ample fairway short of the green, this putting surface is quite small for the distance and difficult to hit with a long club and lots of wind. A trio of bunkers is built into a hill behind the green and tight fairway lies surround the rest of the green. This is a first-rate golf hole. The terrific par 3 8th At 540 yards, the 9th hole is the longest hole at Hyannisport as a lengthy, narrow par 5. From the Black tees, this is easily the most intimidating teeshot on the course with OB lining the entire left side, trees down the right, and a semi-blind plateau to carry. Once you find the fairway, this hole is fairly straightforward with alternating crossbunkers on either side for the final 120 yards and a back-to-front sloped green defended by bunkers on either side. Both accuracy and length are required at the 9th The approach at 9 The 10th hole is an excellent one, but whose similarity to the 7th just a few holes before slightly weakens its effect. Running downhill at 410 yards, this straightaway par 4 features a semi-blind, treelined teeshot to a fairway that slopes hard right-to-left. Long hitters need to be aware of a right crossbunker at 290 yards, but otherwise there is little danger here. This approach plays to an elevated green defended by a bunker left. The par 4 10th The gorgeous approach at 10
At 424 yards uphill, the par 4 11th hole is a difficult slight dogleg right. Featuring a blind teeshot over a plateau, this hole is tree-lined with no bunkers until the final 80 yards. A crossbunker lines the right side of the fairway about 80 yards short and this undulating green is well-defended by three bunkers on either side. The semi-blind par 4 11th The approach at 11
The 12th hole continues a stretch of longer par fours at 415 yards. A sharp dogleg right, this tree-lined hole features a generous fairway that turns at about 230 yards with two bunkers on the inside of the dogleg. From here, this hole is relatively straightforward with a large Redan-like green surrounded only by rough. Leaf rule seems to be in full effect at the 12th The approach at 12 Like the 2nd, the 13th and 14th are consecutive straightaway par fours that fail to leave a lasting memory after playing the course once. At 318 yards, the 13th is a simple hole with a generous, flat fairway devoid of danger besides a bunker down the left at 240 yards. Although you’ll likely only have wedge in, this is one of the better approaches at Hyannisport with a small, back-to-front sloped green guarded by bunkers on either side and a tree short right.


The straightaway par 4 13th

The pretty approach at 13
At 380 yards, the 14th is slightly longer, but also plays flat and straightaway. The fairway is also wide here but narrows around 240 yards with bunkers on both sides. This green is large and lined by bunkers on either side.


The level par 4 14th
Originally the 7th hole on the 1902 course, today’s 15th is a beautiful hole that marks a return to the seaside holes. At 185 yards, this one-shotter runs downhill to a large, back-to-front sloped green lined by deep bunkers on either side. The view behind this green is tremendous and makes you excited for the closing stretch.


The par 3 15th
At just 482 yards, the wonderfully quirky 16th hole is by far the best and most memorable par 5 at Hyannisport. This is an absolutely wild dogleg right where the green is only about 380 yards from the teebox and visible jutting out over the right marshes. This hole plays straightaway for the first 290 yards or so and features a tighter fairway highlighted by a giant uphill slope and plateau at about 250 yards. Just like the notorious closer at Yale, those who don’t reach this plateau may be left a completely blind second shot and not enough room to get the ball high enough quickly. After this plateau, the hole darts to the right downhill with the range down the left and marshland right. This green is open up front and certainly reachable in two but six bunkers surround it long and on both sides. This approach is one of the most beautiful at Hyannisport and this is one of the most unique risk/reward short par fives I’ve played.


The par 5 16th

The all-world approach at 16
The 17th hole is the shortest on the course at just 143 yards, but sits on one of the windiest parts of the property along the marshes. Featuring perhaps the most severe back-to-front slope at Hyannisport, this green is also quite narrow and defended by deep bunkers on either side. A par here demands a controlled ballflight and deft putting touch.


The short par 3 17th
At 310 yards, the closing par 4 plays much longer straight uphill towards the clubhouse. It doesn’t seem like this hole has changed much since 1902 with the range down the left and OB to the far right. Bunkers begin at 270 yards with one down the right and four gorgeous bunkers guard this elevated green long, left, and right. This green also runs extremely hard back-to-front with a false front short.


The closer plays longer than the scorecard

The 18th green is well-defended and difficult

A look from behind the 18th
General Comments: Hyannisport’s unassuming yet charming clubhouse and practice facilities occupy some of the best land on the property sitting on the highest point overlooking Centerville Harbor. It’s hard to imagine a better spot for a clam chowder and cocktail after a round. Practice facilities include a small practice green and short range between the 16th and 18th holes. Like most Cape courses, Hyannisport is mainly a summer retreat and not nearly as busy in the off-season.


The incredible view from the clubhouse

Hyannisport’s driving range
Verdict: Although not quite the best course on the Cape, the exclusive seaside home of The Kennedy Family offers ample fun, several world-class holes, and spectacular views. Hyannisport is absolutely worth the play if you get an invite."

Located on the other side of the county from the famed racetrack—is an exceptional golf course located in very rural Alabama. Designed by the Hurdzan-Fry Environmental Golf Design, Inc team, the course is a very friendly and playable experience. It is a high end public high daily fee course that offers stay and play packages. The course is very well maintained and should be played by anyone visiting Alabama to play the RTJ Trail.  Grade A-
What to Expect:  I would like to share with you, my experience. I had taken a trip to Alabama with my graduating senior son for a golf trip on the RTJ Trail. Like most high school seniors, he is on social media. Somehow, someway—and I can't tell you the particulars, my son in Utah was aware of Pursell Farms. Our flight was later that day and we decided to take the drive and visit Pursell Farms prior to our flight. I am so glad we did. The rural roads that lead into Pursell Farms were like a destination site. It was akin to visiting Dismal River, or Sand Hills. Very remote. You passed old Baptist churches, rolling farmland, two lane roads to the middle of nowhere...but once you got there, immediately I realized this is a special place. I can't speak of the particulars—this is what I gleaned from the workers about the place. This is a generational property and the family over time has made this a reality. The profits from the golf course help support their Christian Ministries and philanthropical pursuits. As you drive into the property, you drive for a while thru rolling farmland that offers shooting, fishing, hunting excursions until you finally come to the golf course and clubhouse. Knowing NOTHING of the property and course, I was immediately excited to play and experience Pursell Farms. I promise anyone who visits will come to the same realization that I had—if you visit the RTJ Trail in Alabama and don't visit Pursell Farms, you have done yourself a disservice. It is a truly special place—with a southern vibe that needs to be experienced. I am so grateful for my son for knowing about this property and sharing it with him.
Individual Hole Analysis
Signature Hole:  7th Hole – 425 Yard Par 4 – I know what everyone wants me to say—the hole number five. The dramatic 175-foot drop to the green. It's dramatic and everyone will photograph that hole. But for me, I have a different hole for differing reasons. What makes Pursell Farms special is all the markers they have on the course. You read about the family, what happened at the particular places on the course. It's a story. A story of a family. Take the time to read the markers and feel their presence. Life is so hectic, but Pursell Farms is an experience. For me, that story is Hole number 7, Big Daddy. A tire swing and the families homestead was there. The singular tree with the tire swing, set against the beautiful trees captured my soul. The hole was beautiful, but the poignant reminders of family were touching. That hole is the essence of Pursell Farms. As I read the marker and walked up the hill to the par three thru the trees, I just felt I was in a special place. More than a golf course. I was part of the story. And that story resonated in my heart. More than just a beautiful hole, it was the combination of all that happened in that area that made this my signature hole.

Best Par 3:  17th Hole – 193 Yards – Many people will remember Hole number five: Hang Time for pictures, etc. It will be the hole that gets your attention. But it is not the best par three on the course. It's most famous due to the dramatic drop off. But the best par three is Big Gulp, number 17 over the pond as you close out your round. Three of the four par threes play downhill and this hole, with the dramatic pond in front and the green situated next to the pond is the best par three on the course. It too is downhill, but not as much as the other two par threes. A bunker on the right side of the green needs to be avoided, but the green nestled between the pond and the beautiful hard woods trees in the back make a dramatic theatre of golf. This is the best par three on the course without a doubt.

Best Par 4:  16th Hole – 393 Yards – The closing holes at Pursell are REALLY special. In fact, Dana's Pick, hole number 16, could be one of the most beautiful holes I have ever seen. A dog leg right hole, slightly uphill to a perched green nestled on the hill side and surrounded by beautiful trees is unforgettable. From a strategic perspective, 16 has all you want and more. This is the type of hole that requires an excellent drive to set up a really good approach to a daunting green with much undulation. Everything about this hole is really good. From a design element, visualization, beauty and setting—this hole has it all. As you play Dana's Pick, you too will understand what I am saying. Words are not sufficient for how good this hole is. For me, it was the best hole on the entire course and one that I will never forget.

Best Par 5:  6th Hole – 600 Yards – Bootlegger is the best par five on the course. The sixth hole is a downhill par five, hitting from an elevated tee box. The hole is in front of you—it lays on the land like it has always been there. The views from the tee box, down the fairway are spectacular. Little land was removed to create this hole, except the trees but is a really good strong par five that requires precision to properly attack the pin and green. The fairway rises to the perched green with slopes off the left and back side of the hole. This particular hole has design elements that I enjoy. From the tee box, the hole allows you to swing away but it requires you to pick the right line—as well as your approach. Though subtle—it forces you to pay attention. A very well designed hole.

Birdie Time:  1st Hole – 576 Yard Par 5 – For clarification, my son and I made a bad decision. Being from Utah, I looked at the score card, saw 6900 yards and we played from those tee boxes. 6900 yards in Utah is way different than 6900 yards in Alabama. I didn't have many birdies (except into 18, I hit a hybrid from 215 on my third shot into 18 to about three feet for my only birdie of the day). Had we played the correct tee boxes, maybe I could give you a better suggestion—maybe the first hole out of the shoot. Hole number one, the Farm is a par five that is pretty benign in its start. A gentle par five that bends slightly to the right would be my thought. A good drive with a hint of fade and good approach will start you out with an opportunity for birdie out of the gate. I didn't make a birdie on that hole because I was in awe of the property from the get-go. A beautiful pond to the right got my attention and the landscape from the start is truly special.

Bogey Beware:  4th Hole – 476 Yard Par 4 – Lower 40, hole number four is a really difficult hole. It's significantly uphill, separated by a stream that intersects the green and the fairway. The hole is a slight dogleg to the left with the contour of the fairway sloping to the right. You need to hit a booming draw and then account for the elevated green perched on the hillside. I am not sure, but my guess is that this is the number one handicap hole on the course. Again, we played the wrong tee box for elevation, etc. But this hole, along with hole number 12, Eureka Railroad were extremely long and difficult. One more thought: Eureka Railroad, if the pin is front left and you are a back left—you can't two putt that hole. I tried! If the pin is left, aim for the right side of the green. Two months after playing the course, I have not forgotten how difficult the green was on number 12—Eureka Railroad. What a special place!"

The course forms the sporting focal point of a property that is part resort, part research and learning centre, where the boundaries of agronomy and agriculture are constantly being pushed by a family business that has been successfully operating in this line of business since 1904.

Feature holes include the pond-protected par fours at the 2nd and 9th and the long, downhill par threes at the 5th and 8th. On the back nine, the 616-yard 18th is a formidable closing hole, with a couple of large oak trees and three fairway bunkers blocking the most direct route to the home green.

The following edited extract by architect Michael Hurdzan is from Volume Six of Golf Architecture: A Worldwide Perspective. Reproduced with kind permission. To obtain a copy of the book, email Paul Daley at fswing@bigpond.net.au.

“At the epicentre of FarmLinks is the Pursell family, who for generations has lived on farms near Sylacauga, about fifty miles south of Birmingham. In 1904, descendants of the family formed and managed the Sylacauga Fertiliser Company that served local cotton farmers.

As each successful generation took over and managed the company, they sought to develop new technologies and markets. Over time, they developed a worldwide market for their high-tech fertiliser, Polyon, an encapsulated, slow-release fertiliser that is ideal for golf courses.

To showcase ground-breaking products, Pursell Technologies began to offer tours of its fertiliser plant. In 2001, under the leadership of then-CEO David Pursell, the firm began construction of his vision for FarmLinks golf course – the world’s first research and development golf course ‘to serve as a living laboratory’.

When FarmLinks opened in 2003, Pursell could then show clients their products in actual use on the course. So, at first, FarmLinks was intended as a way to demonstrate and market Pursell technologies products: but David saw how an even broader impact could be made by having so-called partners.

Importantly, these partners would not be competitors but rather companies that made and sold irrigation equipment, mowers and maintenance equipment, golf cars and pest control. Under this arrangement, these companies could now also test, compare and market their products on a course dedicated to Best Management Practices.

So, FarmLinks’ second incarnation was a broad-based industry showcase. Pursell Technologies sold its fertiliser business in 2008 but kept the golf course and its partners. The year 2011 marked the third life for FarmLinks: the world’s first educational program tailored for greens’ committee members and non-technical course superintendents.

Since the goal for the golf course was outreach education, small groups of superintendents and golf officials are invited to come to FarmLinks and stay for a couple of days of relaxed education. The guests stay at Parker Lodger, meals are prepared and served family-style in the large dining room, and guests relax and socialise in the great room, game room or multi-purpose room.

The program is wildly successful. Even so, David Pursell believed that the outreach was too limited; and so they re-evaluated and decided to develop a program for non-technical decision makers, such as those who chair the greens’ committees, sports turf supervisors and international guests interested in golf.

The intention is to give the students enough basic agronomy and business practice, and mix the knowledge liberally with hands-on practical exercise on the golf course. At the end, it is hoped the student understands how grass grows, the stresses caused by maintenance (and) what the superintendent has to do to counter those stresses.

FarmLinks is far more than just a fun test of golf, for it is also a living laboratory and educational outreach facility that distinguishes it as ‘first among equals’. Plans are to continue to expand the invitation list to include a wider variety of international guests from countries where golf is well-established, as well as places where golf is just starting to grow.”"

Grade B+

What to Expect:  Ak-Chin Southern Dunes is located 35 miles south of Phoenix outside the famed hub of Scottsdale courses; but you'd be amiss to skip it on a visit to the desert. The Lee Schmidt and Brian Curley design certainly stands as one of the more enjoyable courses to play in Arizona since it doesn't play like target desert golf that so many courses in the area do. While it is known for its difficulty due to the overall length paired with the plethora of bunkers featuring varying depths, the fairway widths are plenty forgiving and the greensites are fair so that you don't feel like you are getting punished all round. Speaking of greensites, rather than big undulations, Southern Dunes features sweeping greens where the slope is consistent and requires a deft touch with your putter to navigate the speed and line just right. In fact, when I think of Ak-Chin Southern Dunes, I think about the greens. Players will find the setting appealing from the perspective of it having a bit more of a parkland feel with a wide variety of trees and native desert plants rather than just cacti, rocks, and sand like so many courses in the Grand Canyon State. The terrain is also pretty tame so walking the course would be relatively easy though most players elect to take a cart. One thing that stands out is the great variety of hole lengths and shapes that will consistently test your game while begging you to utilize every club in the bag; and what more can you ask for than that? In the end, Ak-Chin Southern Dunes is a really good course in the Phoenix area. It tests your game, has great variety, and will make you a better putter. If it were located in Scottsdale, it would get a lot more hype than it does now.
Individual Hole Analysis
Signature Hole:  10th Hole – 412 Yard Par 4 – The 10th is a dogleg right that runs alongside a pond before it gives way to a bunker and the fairway bends around it to the greensite. That bunker encroaches out from the right into the fairway and fronts part of the green, a green that has more sand left and right of it than it has grass to putt on. Deciding how much of the corner to cut with the tee shot is the most critical element to success here and the multiple hazards add a layer of strategy to it.
10th Hole at Ak-Chin Southern Dunes Golf Club (412 Yard Par 4)
Best Par 3:  4th Hole – 165 Yards – A very wide but shallow green, the 4th at Ak-Chin Southern Dunes will require your best distance control to come out successful. The putting surface measures 36 yards wide but only 1/3 as deep along most of the green and has bunkers in front and back to fall in if you don't execute properly. The high lip on the bunker fronting the left third of the green can impede the view for that portion of the green which sits nearest to the golfer while back right pins will be the furthest away and most challenging to hit close.
4th Hole at Ak-Chin Southern Dunes Golf Club (165 Yard Par 3)
Best Par 4:  2nd Hole – 370 Yards – A hole that essentially doglegs 90 degrees right, the short par four 2nd offers a generous landing area on the left but tries to tempt players on the right to take an aggressive line at the green. A large bunker 90 yards short of the green comes into play on the right side and continues nearly all the way to the edge of the green and would require 315 yards of carry from the back tee to cover. Laying up to the left will leave an approach to the green where the angle will give you nearly three times more depth to work with than width, effectively requiring you to hit one of your most precise shots of the day.
2nd Hole at Ak-Chin Southern Dunes Golf Club (370 Yard Par 4)
Best Par 5:  13th Hole – 606 Yards – Stretching out over 600 yards, the 13th is a sizable journey located along the western boundary of the property. The fairway bends slowly and steadily to the right the entire way to the green with desert lining both sides of the fairway. The steady uphill ascension of the design makes the hole play longer than the yardage indicates and the green sits at the base of a berm that sets the background. Players trying to reach as close to the green in two as possible will find the largest bunker on the course looming on the left side 75 yards short of the green's front edge.
13th Hole at Ak-Chin Southern Dunes Golf Club (606 Yard Par 5)
Birdie Time:  14th Hole – 323 Yard Par 4 – While it may appear that there is more sand than grass to hit with the tee shot, trust your swing and make your main goal to carry the trio of bunkers coming in from the left. There is a 50 yard deep landing zone between those bunkers and the green that is the perfect spot to hit a flip wedge from and an opportunity to get it close to the hole. The sides and back of the green are surrounded by bunkers, but the opening in the front is all grass so that you can come in high or low with your approach shot.
14th Hole at Ak-Chin Southern Dunes Golf Club (323 Yard Par 4)
Bogey Beware:  8th Hole – 484 Yard Par 4 – Named ""Hardest,"" the 8th is certainly that at Ak-Chin Southern Dunes. Playing a bit shy of 500 yards and giving you just four strokes to get in the hole, the 8th will require your best effort to avoid a bogey. The tee shot is pinched by four bunkers in the driving zone; two on each side of the fairway. From there, the angle of the fairway and bunker placement asks players to hit a draw into the green where they will then face a steadily sloping putting surface that makes gauging the speed and line perfectly an extreme challenge.

74,Ak-Chin Southern Dunes Golf Club,non100,"Maricopa, AZ",Lee Schmidt/Brian Curley,2002,Course Review(s): Ak-Chin Southern Dunes Golf Club,Bogeys Across America,rev074_ak-chin_southern_2,"After my warm-up round at The Duke at Rancho El Dorado, I headed a few miles down the road to Ak-Chin Southern Dunes Golf Club. Whereas The Duke is pretty much right in the small town of Maricopa, Ak-Chin Southern Dunes is much more isolated with no homes or signs of civilization around the course. That is easily part of the overall appeal here.

I had a 12:20 tee time and was paired with a threesome of PGA club pros. It really adds some pressure to your game when you are playing with such skilled players. They played the gold tees (6,902 yards) while I played the blues (6,493). Not even they wanted to play the black tees (7,330) or the even-further-back tips (7,546), which didn’t even have markers out on Tuesday.

Ak-Chin Southern Dunes was opened in 2002. I believe it was originally just called Southern Dunes and then was renamed Royal Dunes for a brief period under a different owner. Then the Ak-Chin Reservation took over the course and hence the current name. The course was designed by Schmidt-Curley with the assistance of Fred Couples. Their goal was to have more of a Scottish links-inspired layout rather than a typical “desert” course.

It’s hard to not feel like a desert course when you are smack dab in the middle of the desert, but you can definitely sense the links concept here with rolling terrain and ample bunkering.

Really the story of Ak-Chin Southern Dunes is the abundance of sand. You can’t escape it. Every shot is affected by the threat of menacing bunkers and desert waste areas. There is only one water hazard on the course that comes into play on holes 10 and 18. Otherwise, it’s all about the bunkering. There are so many bunkers. Some are massive. Some are small. All are best avoided if you want to post a decent score. The bunkers cut across fairways and shape the doglegs. They effectively guard the greens and provide visual intimidation on each approach shot. They also create optical illusions at times, meaning what looks like a greenside bunker from the fairway may actually be 50 yards short of the green surface.

I truly can’t think of another course I’ve played where the bunkers have this much impact on strategy. Ak-Chin Southern Dunes is a course that demands careful thinking and proper execution.

I should note there is always ample bail-out room on your tee shots. The bunkers usually just help you determine how aggressive you want to be with your lines. As you get closer to any given green, however, the sand traps will come more and more into play.

If you are able to avoid the bunkers, you will still have some rather tricky greens to deal with. The green complexes at Ak-Chin Southern Dunes come in some funky shapes and don’t always offer a lot of room to work with on approach shots. Add in some false edges and undulations, and you get another major element of challenge on this course.

And, I haven’t even mentioned the wind yet. The wind was very inconsistent during our round. Sometimes it was blowing hard and other times it was dead calm. However, given the location and the isolation of this course, I can imagine it gets really, really windy here on certain days.

One thing I liked about Ak-Chin Southern Dunes on a personal level is that this course definitely favors a left-to-right ball flight as most doglegs turn to the right. However, with no big trees in play, you can effectively work your way around this course with any type of shot shape.

I’m not sure what is considered the signature hole here. A lot of the course does blend together a bit. The 18th definitely sticks out as unique because of the water hazard guarding the green.

I do wish there was more of a signature par-3 on this course. All the par-3s are nice and demanding in their own ways, but I wasn’t particularly blown away by any one of them. I’d probably pick the 4th as my favorite of the bunch with the most intricate bunkering guarding the front of the green.

The conditions here were excellent overall. The tee boxes were nice. The fairways were great. The ground underneath was firm, so that offered nice roll-out. However, the grass on top was always fluffy enough to provide good lies. The overseeded rough was also nice throughout, though there are quite a few burrowing animal holes that are unfortunate to see. The bunkers generally had good sand. I think they could use some reappropriation of the sand, though. In general, they seemed to be on the firm/thin side at the bottom and super soft around the edges (I had one ball plug under the lip), which is the opposite of how it should be if you ask me. The greens were super firm and pretty quick. Not even the PGA pros could get balls to stop on some of these greens with wedges in hand!

The greater Phoenix/Scottsdale area is obviously loaded with exceptional golf and Ak-Chin Southern Dunes is another to put in the upper tier of public-accessible courses. It’s definitely a must-play if you are looking south of the city."
75,Fossil Trace Golf Club,non100,"Golden, CO",Jim Engh,2003,"Fossil Trace Golf Club (Golden, Colorado)",Bill Satterfield,rev075_fossil_trace_1,"What to Expect:  Fossil Trace is an excellent public access facility named for the dinosaur fossils found in the area. Jim Engh spent several years on the project working through a variety of challenges but finally came up with a great course that is different from your typical muni. Be prepared to face a hole with an incinerator in the fairway, another with boulders in the fairway, and plenty of wild greens and bunkers to contend with.
Individual Hole Analysis
Signature Hole:  12th Hole – 585 Yard Par 5 – Jim Engh has a flare for the dramatic and Fossil Trace's signature hole shows why. How many golf holes have you played that feature three large boulders resting in the fairway? I've only played one and it is this exciting par five that also boasts a pair of deep ""muscle"" bunkers.
12th Hole at Fossil Trace Golf Club (585 Yard Par 5)
Best Par 3:  16th Hole – 160 Yards – Jim Engh loves to tuck greens behind water hazards and the 16th hole fits right in with that scheme. The green sits in a bowl which makes going long safe but shots hit short will either find the expansive bunker or will find the drink.
16th Hole at Fossil Trace Golf Club (160 Yard Par 3)
Best Par 4:  13th Hole – 394 Yards – This par four requires some strategy to succeed at scoring well. First, don't pull out your driver because missing the fairway is death. Second, know the pin placement to optimize your approach shot strategy. Third, a two-putt anywhere on this green is an accomplishment.
13th Hole at Fossil Trace Golf Club (394 Yard Par 4)
Best Par 5:  12th Hole – 585 Yards – This signature par five features OB right of the cart path so the logical play is up the safer left side. However, reaching the green in two from the left side means playing a draw through the boulders and over the muscle bunker fronting this shallow green. Good luck!
12th Hole at Fossil Trace Golf Club (585 Yard Par 5)
Birdie Time:  2nd Hole – 320 Yard Par 4 – While some might argue that the 96 yard 5th hole is a great birdie opportunity, I think more players will find a way to get under par on the 320 yard 2nd hole. The design allows for drives to chase up on the green for an eagle putt while the green sits 25 feet below the fairway in a bowl that is almost impossible to miss with a short approach shot. Knock it stiff and go one under.

Bogey Beware:  9th Hole – 659 Yard Par 5 – Measuring 659 yards and featuring a skinny green, the 9th hole at Fossil Trace is a brute, a definite three-shot hole, and a common bogey. But the day I played it featured a howling head wind which took this long par five and made it near impossible to score well. I don't know if it is generally windy in Golden and if the wind generally runs in your face on this hole, but if it does then this is one of the most difficult holes in the state!"
76,Fossil Trace Golf Club,non100,"Golden, CO",Jim Engh,2003,FOSSIL TRACE GOLF CLUB,Two Guys Who Golf,rev076_fossil_trace_2,"Fossil Trace in Golden Colorado, in our opinion - is the MUST PLAY course in the Denver region. Jim Engh deserves credit for coming up with a gorgeous design but he had some top rate golf property to work with. Named as the 2nd Best New Affordable Course in America by Golf Digest in 2003 and nestled in the foothills of the Rocky Mountain's front range, this course simply put is one of the most interesting layouts we have encountered anywhere!
Fossil Trace has been honored as a 4-1/2 star course by Golf Digest Places to Play since 2006, and was also named the Best Course in Denver by ESPN.com from 2006 to the present. With rates topping out at around $75 prime time including cart (residents have discounted rates), this also is one of the best golf values in the country. The property is also home to the Fossil Trace Golf Academy, with a great variety of lessons, clinics and golf schools available. The Junior and Family golf programs are some of the best the state has to offer.
On property is a clubhouse with pro shop and restaurant/lounge serving breakfast, lunch and dinner menus. The outdoor patio features spectacular vistas of the golf course and surrounding area, and there also are separate outing/event facilities. Visage GPS is standard on all carts, but the course is also well marked with yardage stones measured to the front, middle and back of the green from 75 yards out to 275 yards out.
There are 7 sets of tees that play to distances of 6831, 6577, 6241, 5933, 5559, 5197 and 4681 with slopes ranging from 117 to 138 and ratings from 66.5 to 72.3. Golfers familiar with Engh designs will be accustomed to the long, deep, penal, intricately designed soft sand bunkers that highlight his layouts - and they are plentiful on this beautiful course. There are just 37 sand traps located along the fairways or situated greenside, but the strategic placing and length of the designs truly make these bunkers hazardous.
Players will find the 12th hole memorable - with stunning red rock outcroppings and formations situated in the middle of the fairway and greenside. Another unique characteristic is the frequent occurrence of bowl effect fairways and slopes greenside that feed the ball towards the hole. The opening hole is also a stunner - as the approach plays downhill over or around a unique chimney rock formation that is situated in the center of the fairway. Several holes play from elevated tees, and most of the green complexes are protected by sand traps, mounds and swales forming collection areas that create challenging up and down situations. The putting surfaces are often multi tiered and very undulating.
The water features are spectacular, and affect the tee shots or approaches on 7 of the holes, including the beautiful finishing hole, which is highlighted by a lake that runs the length of the hole and demands an accurate approach to small sloping green. Practice facilities on property include a targeted grass range, short game area with sand bunker plus large putting green."

In addition to offering some stellar photo ops, the course is much more fun than the standard residential Florida track.  Grade B+

What to Expect:  When you play golf in Florida, you don't expect a lot of elevation changes or movement in the terrain. So teeing it up on the Quarry course at Black Diamond Ranch is a treat as it is rare to find a flat hole. Holes 13-17 are clearly the highlight of the course as they are routed through a former rock quarry and feature dramatic hole designs and landscape, however the holes leading up to them are great as well and would get more acclaim if the quarry holes weren't so stunning. The variety of the par fours is particularly outstanding while the greens throughout the course aren't terribly compelling compared to most Fazio courses and could benefit from a renovation to the putting surfaces. The opening tee shot of the day sets the tone right off the bat with a dramatic 45 foot drop down to the fairway and then facing a slightly uphill approach shot. While some of the holes play through a residential neighborhood, they don't feel on top of you as much as they do at the Ranch course due to the distance the homes sit off the fairway and how the heavier tree lines that frame the fairways help deliver some isolation. The par threes are certainly a highlight, particularly in the Quarry, but the course's weakest feature is the routing that necessitates riding in a cart to cover the lack of continuity through portions of the course. Overall, the Quarry course at Black Diamond Ranch is a very good track to enjoy with plenty of movement in the terrain, but it is the quarry holes that make it what it is.

Individual Hole Analysis
Signature Hole:  15th Hole – 371 Yard Par 4 – One of the most recognizable holes in all of Florida, the 15th at Black Diamond Ranch's Quarry course is stunning to behold. This relatively short par four features water up the entire left side with bunkering meandering its way along the fairway and all the way to the green. The elevated tee is exciting to hit from but also can cause some trepidation since the fairway gets thinner the further towards the green it gets. There is a small second fairway on the right that can be laid up to if avoiding the water becomes the primary concern, but a drive down the center of the main fairway will set up a great birdie opportunity. The green moves to the left away from players with the water become a greater concern on the approach shot and will require some guts to go after the day's flag.
15th Hole at Black Diamond Ranch (Quarry) (371 Yard Par 4)
Best Par 3:  13th Hole – 183 Yards – The beginning of the quarry holes is found here at the one-shot 13th. An impressive golf hole, the tee shot plays over a former digging area to a green perched on the high ground on the opposite side. A half dozen bunkers surround the green with the largest portion of the putting surface accounting for the near side of the green while the pin position in the smaller rear shelf of the green will take serious skill to hit. It is an exciting tee shot and great way to start the Quarry's stunning set of upcoming holes.
13th Hole at Black Diamond Ranch (Quarry) (183 Yard Par 3)
Best Par 4:  16th Hole – 435 Yards – A challenging two-shotter that runs along the northern end of the former quarry site, the 16th plays uphill to a fairway that is difficult to see but bunkers on the inside of the hole do stand out as a visual to work from. The ideal tee shot carries the boulders ahead and stays left of the bunker on the right. The further left you go, the greater the award for the approach, but missing too far left will often result in a lost ball. The approach shot will need to carry a chasm to a bunkerless greensite with a small bulb upfront and much more room in the rear half of the green. The slope in the green can be utilized to come up the right side and work the ball back towards the center of the putting surface.
16th Hole at Black Diamond Ranch (Quarry) (435 Yard Par 4)
Best Par 5:  5th Hole – 577 Yards – The only non-quarry hole featured in the review, the par five 5th is a solid hole for being found on the less engaging portion of the property. The tee shot plays to a fairway that slopes from left to right which is why the fairway bunker is found on the right side. An oak tree with Spanish moss on the left side of the fairway is a good target and will be more predominantly in view during the second shot. The fairway then runs straight ahead before the green bends to the right and is tucked behind a bunker. Getting home in two is a real challenge, so staying up the left side will provide the best angle to attack the green on the third shot.
5th Hole at Black Diamond Ranch (Quarry) (577 Yard Par 5)
Birdie Time:  14th Hole – 529 Yard Par 5 – Wrapping around the southern portion of the former quarry, the 14th is a risk/reward par five that presents a great opportunity to take a stroke back from Old Man Par. The fairway wraps from right to left and will temp players to challenge the left side knowing that a hook into the quarry will quickly result in a lost ball. But players who successfully challenge the left side will be in the go-zone for attacking the green in two. The green sits down quite a bit from the fairway and promotes players hitting the fairway right of the green and utilizing the slope in the terrain to tumble the ball onto the putting surface; though the longer grass can hold it up at times. This is an exciting hole and laying up doesn't guarantee a great look at the green due to its depressed site.
14th Hole at Black Diamond Ranch (Quarry) (529 Yard Par 5)
Bogey Beware:  17th Hole – 214 Yard Par 3 – Tom Fazio isn't going to let you out of the quarry without one last challenge, in fact, it is the course's biggest challenge. The lengthy one-shotter plays over a dig site to a smallish green with a strong tier across it. The tier creates a small front third and a much larger back two-thirds in the green and nowhere to miss that you'll be happy with. The rock wall on the left will give a multitude of different kicks while the gnarly grass bunkers on the right will have inconsistent lies that will be challenging to save par from. This hole stands as the most challenging green in regulation to hit on the course and pars here should be celebrated.

It is an integral part of what is considered to be the number one golf community in the state. Together with the 18-hole Ranch course, 9-hole Highlands course, 30-bay driving range and 800 homes, this development is contained within 1,320 acres of land.

The Black Diamond Ranch Quarry course features prominently in every recent American golf course survey and it’s obvious straight from the off. Early in your round at the Quarry course you can’t help but marvel at the dogwoods, myrtles and magnolias that line the fairways, but you can’t help your mind racing on in anticipation of what lies ahead. From the 13th to the 17th, the Quarry course takes on its signature character – these holes are fashioned over and around canyon walls which offer excitement and spectacular views.

At the 13th hole, you stand on the elevated tee seventy-five feet above the quarry floor and catch your breath as you look over a huge abyss in front of the green 183 yards away – some have likened it to playing the 8th hole at Pebble Beach. Corey Pavin loves the 15th; in fact, he thinks it’s the most beautiful golf hole in Florida. The tee sits over seventy-five feet above the fairway and water is in play down the entire left side to a green that is tucked around the edge of the water – it's such a stunning hole that it is really hard to focus on the task at hand.

The last of these five fabulous holes is the par three 17th, which is 204 yards of rugged beauty that demands accuracy. There are lateral hazards on both sides of this hole, large bunkers on the right side of the green and quarry walls on the left – a great conclusion to the wonderful Quarry course at Black Diamond Ranch."

The former home club of golfing legend Bobby Jones, the impressive clubhouse is laced with memorabilia from Jones’ illustrious career. The club used to welcome standard memberships, but is in the process of converting everything into corporate memberships where the club can entertain clients near downtown Atlanta. The Donald Ross design can best be described as “pleasant” with gentle contours and a relaxing setting. Trees line the fairways but are sparse enough that the golfer is afforded views of much of the course from several different locations on the property. Not only does East Lake host the Tour Championship at the end of the PGA Tour season, the course formerly finished with a par three until the nines were reversed.
Individual Hole Analysis
Signature Hole:  15th Hole – 213 Yard Par 3 – The first island green in America was designed as the 15th hole at East Lake Golf Club in Atlanta (originally the 6th hole). Already a challenging target to hit, the club has pushed the championship tee box back to behind the lake and requires the golfer to fly the ball 200+ yards over water before seeing any signs of dry land. This heroic tee shot will instantly put a smile or a frown on your face.
15th Hole at East Lake Golf Club (213 Yard Par 3)
Best Par 3:  9th Hole – 232 Yards – For years this was the finishing hole, but the PGA Tour didn't like closing on a par three for the Tour Championship and so the nines were reversed. Uphill all the way, the tee shot on the 9th may be your most challenging all day. A pond sits in front of the tee box and isn't in play for most golfers, but the deep bunkers on either side of this sloping green factor in for everyone. If you get above the hole, your knees will be knocking trying to corral your next shot near the hole at the most difficult two-tiered green on the course.
9th Hole at East Lake Golf Club (232 Yard Par 3)
Best Par 4:  17th Hole – 407 Yards – The second shortest par four on the course is also one of its best. The tees have been lengthed from the original layout and have made it increasingly difficult to contend with and carry the trees and bunkers protecting the inside corner of this dogleg left. A deep mote bunker encirles the front of the firm green and demands distance control from the golfer's approach shot in order to make birdie a legit option.
17th Hole at East Lake Golf Club (407 Yard Par 4)
Best Par 5:  18th Hole – 589 Yards – The 18th hole is my favorite at East Lake and delivers the challenge and options I love to see in a golf hole. Off the tee the line isn't completely clear to a first time visitor as the fairway dives downhill and to the left out of view. With water looming in the distance the golfer must decide between a fairway metal off the tee and likely having to layup on the second shot, or whether to pound the driver up the left side in hopes of finding the fairway and the slope of the fairway which will feed the ball into position in order to reach the green in two. The safer tee shot up the right side of the hole brings water into play on the second shot as the player can use the clubhouse in the distance as an aiming target. A pair of deep bunkers protect the green that angles away from the golfer and finishes off an excellent grouping of challenges on this hole.

Birdie Time:  14th Hole – 559 Yard Par 5 – Anytime a hole is shortened a tad and considered a par four for the PGA Tour, it offers an excellent chance for us regular guys to score a birdie when it plays as a par five. That is the case on the 5th hole at East Lake that plays well downhill and generates some forwards kick in the fairway that setup long iron approach shots to reach this green in two. Beyond the green a large pond looms, but the front of the green is open and accepting to shots chasing into the putting surface. I got lucky the day I played at East Lake and was able to stick my 220 yard approach shot to kick-in distance of the hole and carded a rare eagle.
14th Hole at East Lake Golf Club (559 Yard Par 5)
Bogey Beware:  2nd Hole – 455 Yard Par 4 – How this hole ranks as the #14 handicap on the card baffles me. Water runs the entire left side of the hole with the fairway sloping toward the hazard. Bailing out to the right opens up the green while at the same time requiring precise distance control on the approach to avoid the water behind the green while hitting the ball hard enough to carry the steep slope fronting the green. The deep bunkers surrounding the putting surface are difficult to save par out of if thoughts of fear run through your mind of skulling it into the water. This hole is a beast.

80,East Lake Golf Course,non100,"Atlanta, GA","Tom Bendelow, 1908/ Donald Ross 1994",1908,East Lake,top100golfcourses,rev080_east_lake_golf_club_2,"East Lake’s history is truly moving so we think it is worth sharing. Tom Bendelow originally designed the East Lake course as a golfing accompaniment for the members of the Atlanta Athletic Club. The course was laid out in the suburbs of Atlanta on the site of an old amusement park and the course opened for play in July 1908. A young six-year old called Bob was at the East Lake opening ceremony in the company of his father, Colonel Robert P. Jones.
East Lake Golf Club played host to the 1963 Ryder Cup matches between the USA and Great Britain. Team Captains were Arnold Palmer (US) and John Fallon (GB). Britain adopted a new strategy for the 15th edition of Ryder Cup matches using a non-playing Captain for the first time. The US did not follow suit and placed Arnold Palmer at the playing helm. “The King” in his debut as Captain led his team in fine style to the second largest winning margin in Ryder Cup history. USA 23 - GB 9. The Ryder Cup was played at Royal Lytham & St Annes in 1961 and at Royal Birkdale in 1965.

In 1913, the famous Scottish architect Donald Ross redesigned East Lake creating two loops of nine holes and in 1928 he returned to fashion a second East Lake course which opened in 1930 to coincide with Bobby’s Grand Slam victory celebrations. Beverly Hanson won the 1950 U.S. Women’s Amateur here, accepting the Robert Cox Trophy from Bobby Jones.

George Cobb made a few minor alterations to the original course ahead of the 1963 Ryder Cup which culminated in a resounding 23 points to 9 victory for Team USA against a beleaguered Great Britain & Ireland squad.

East Lake’s luck soon changed after the 1963 Ryder Cup as the Atlanta neighbourhood fell into urban decline. The Atlanta Athletic Club sold the second course to developers and moved out. But 25 members stepped in and saved the original course and formed the East Lake Golf Club. In the early 1970s public housing was built on the site of No.2 course and the area soon became a center for poverty, drugs and violence. East Lake slowly but surely degenerated.

In Golf Courses of the PGA Tour by George Peper, the author states: “Enter its saviour, Tom Cousins. A prosperous real estate developer who had developed the Omni Complex and NationsBank Plaza in downtown Atlanta, Cousins had fond memories of East Lake from when he had played it as a youngster in the 1940s. Employing the resources of his own charitable foundation he revamped the golf club and used it as a tool to revitalize the surrounding area.

The housing project was razed and replaced with 500 mixed-income apartments and townhouses surrounding the golf course... At the same time, Cousins sold 100 corporate memberships at $75,000 each (asking each corporation to contribute an additional $200,000 to the revival of the area).”

In 1994, Rees Jones was called in. Using the original drawings, Donald Ross’s 1926 design was re-born. Today’s East Lake is the driving force behind the effort to revitalise this Atlanta neighbourhood. All profits from the club go to support the East Lake Community Foundation and as a consequence East Lake now stands as a symbol of hope as well as tradition.

We raise our glass to East Lake but we’ve just noticed that we haven’t mentioned anything about the course... click here to find out more or scroll down to read the course reviews.

In addition to staging the 1963 Ryder Cup matches, East Lake also held the 2001 US Amateur Championship which was claimed by Bubba Dickerson, winning the last two holes of the 36-hole final for a thrilling 1-up victory. East Lake is also host venue for the season-ending Tour Championship, which has been held consecutively here in Atlanta since 2004."

83,Black Sheep Golf Club,non100,"Sugar Grove, IL",David Esler,2002,"Black Sheep Golf Club (Sugar Grove, Illinois)",Bill Satterfield,rev083_black_sheep_1,"The Takeaway:  In the golf mecca metro of Chicago, Black Sheep holds its head high as one of the best and most unique tracks you can experience in Illinois. The men's only club features a walkable routing, excellent conditioning, and admirable architecture that relies on subtleties rather than dramatics to create a course you'd love to play over and over.  Grade B+
What to Expect:  Black Sheep is a men's only club located on former farming ground an hour west of downtown Chicago. The 27 hole club is a prairie links design with gently rolling terrain that nicely facilitates walking your round although carts are available as well. The course is characterized by rugged edged bunkers, golden fescue, and expansive rural views. The course is highlighted by near flawless conditioning paired with an excellent routing that make playing the course a pleasure each and every time around the loop. The facilities are understated as you might expect from a men's club that only cares about one thing; golf. You won't find homes on the course or traditional country club facilities like swimming pools or tennis courts, just the necessary elements to operate a upper end golf course. A prompt pace of play is accomplished with wide fairways and a membership that appreciates that style of play. The layout is characterized by risk/reward play where the more you are willing to challenge hazards off the tee, the greater the angle for the second shot and ability to score well. Though the property isn't as undulated or architecture as elite, Black Sheep reminded me of Shinnecock Hills with the inland links vibe and the clubhouse sitting on top of the highest point on the property. The fact that this club is being mentioned in the same sentence as Shinnecock Hills ought to tell you just how great Black Sheep is.
Individual Hole Analysis
Signature Hole:  9th Hole – 419 Yard Par 4 – The closing hole of the opening nine plays uphill towards the farm style clubhouse and runs parallel to the club's entrance road. With no protection from the wind, players will often find their tee shot getting knocked down some and will then need to take a longer club into the green to combat the wind and uphill terrain. The approach shot to this flag is one of the most challenging of the day with part of the green being blind, particularly from the right side of the fairway. This blind look proved to be especially suspenseful after Rich's 181 yard approach shot went pinseeking. Upon cresting the putting surface, we discovered his ball in the bottom of the cup; yet another eagle for a guy that seems to hole out from everywhere except the tee box as the search for his first hole in one continues to elude him.
9th Hole at Black Sheep Golf Club (419 Yard Par 4)
Best Par 3:  3rd Hole – 204 Yards – The first one-shotter at Black Sheep is also its best. Playing downhill the entire way to the green, this hole is attractively framed by bunkers and trees to give it a memorable and inviting look. The putting surface is large and undulated enough to generate its fair share of three-putts, especially for those that may not have adjusted to the green speeds yet.
3rd Hole at Black Sheep Golf Club (204 Yard Par 3)
Best Par 4:  5th Hole – 305 Yards – This drivable par four is half angel and half devil. The short distance unveils the angel side of the hole as players start salivating at the chance of an easy birdie. However the devil side quickly surfaces if players go for the green and aren't deadly accurate due to the water, bunkering, and unplayable areas protecting the hole. The smart play is to take an iron off the tee and then wedge it into the green, but that is only if you are able to listen to the angel on your shoulder and not the devil.
5th Hole at Black Sheep Golf Club (305 Yard Par 4)
Best Par 5:  2nd Hole – 535 Yards – When I got to the 2nd hole I knew I was going to like Black Sheep. The creativity of the fairway contours, attractive bunkering, and strategy found on this hole are highlights of the front nine design. Bunkers are found on each side of the fairway near the common landing zone. Players that challenge the bunker on the right and successfully carry their tee ball 250 yards to clear it will be rewarded with a great chance to reach the green in two with a hybrid or long iron. However, the entire right side of the green is protected by a large bunker that stares back at players daring to take a rip at the green. The circular green is 32 yards deep with plenty of pin positions that may dictate your aggressiveness with your second shot.
2nd Hole at Black Sheep Golf Club (535 Yard Par 5)
Birdie Time:  18th Hole – 497 Yard Par 5 – Even going uphill, any sub-500 yard par five should have players looking to take a stroke back from old man par. Though some fairway bunkering can thwart the goal of taking a four here, the fairway is pretty generous and reaching this green in two can often be done with less than a fairway wood. While the PGA Tour may prefer to finish championship courses with a long par four, us everyday Joe's love to have an easy hole to go out on so that we can walk off the course with a smile on our face and this is your chance.
18th Hole at Black Sheep Golf Club (497 Yard Par 5)
Bogey Beware:  14th Hole – 464 Yard Par 4 – This lengthy par four plays to a driving zone that is tightened down by a bunker on the right and garbage on the left. The green features one of the more narrow openings on the course and is protected on the right by a large bunker. With the wind likely whipping through the course at this point in the round, you'll need to be on your 'A' game to conquer this two-shotter.

One of four men’s only clubs in the state of Illinois (which makes up about a fifth to sixth of the total in the US), Solano developed Black Sheep to provide its membership a true home-away-from-home, with a comfortable but well-appointed, functional open clubhouse with a locker room, pro shop and a great room / bar area. It has everything it needs, and little it doesn’t.

There is no pool. No tennis courts. No dining room. No dress code.

There are no menus and no kitchen. The dining options are burger or chicken sandwich from the grill out back, or their famous peanut butter and jalapeno sandwich (there may have been a few pre-made options in the refrigerator that I missed).

There is no waitstaff. In fact, there are very few employees, in general, although those who are there including PGA Head Golf Professional Kevin Healy are tremendously helpful and accommodating, and will help throughout the clubhouse.


Black Sheep: One of the best logos in golf.

All of this adds up to an intimate experience with low overhead. That means members get an elite, top-100 club with the lowest dues of any private course in the Chicago area (just over $7k/year, although initiation is ~ $35k), no food and beverage minimums, and no reliance on outside cash flow. With no need to host outside events on Mondays, for example, the course is open to membership seven days a week.

Black Sheep has 27 holes of fantastic David Esler designed golf that ebbs and inhales across a vast 285 acres of Illinois prairie land.

The holes Esler laid out will test every club in the bag, and will reward players who can pull off drawn and cut shot shapes while allowing for straight and steady play down its forgiving fairways.

The golf course at Black Sheep is one of the best competition courses I’ve ever played.

In fact, it played host this day to our 2019 Illinois vs. Wisconsin Writer’s Cup match.

A look back at the clubhouse from beyond the tenth hole green site.

One of my favorite holes on the course is the lightning bolt shaped par five 11th. The fairway runs out from the tee, and helped turbo-charge my 275-ish yard drive well over 300.

.

Any 200-yard shot at the green in two, though, will need to carry a ton of greenside bunkers and would be ill-advised, at best. There is a ton of room short and left of the green for laying up and leaves a great angle in.


A look at the fairway transition on the par five 11th, from around 260 yards out.

The course uses elevation well, especially on the par threes. My favorite is the short 25th, measuring just 135 yards to a postage stamp sized green that slopes hard from back to front.

Proximity on the tee shot is the whole game here. Anything outside 15 feet will leave a challenging two-putt, and anything short will likely be marooned well below the putting surface.


The short par three 25th hole, from 135 yards over fescue and sand.

One of my favorite holes on the course is the par five second. Tipping out at 535 yards, this is a great three-shot hole that will penalize players for getting overly aggressive.

The third is a beautiful downhill par three with a bevy of teeing options. The tee box nearest the second hole green is the highest, and forces players to take on more of the sand traps front-right of the green.


Tee highest tee box on 3, fairly straight-on.

The next set of tees offers a straight-on approach with a clear lane to the green, and slightly less elevation.


Different tee, different angle on 3.

The fifth continues my favorite stretch of holes at Black Sheep Golf Club, a drivable par four that is risk/reward at its very best.

Under 300 yards to the green, the putting surface is partially hidden by a volcano bunker front-left, and is one of the most heavily sloped greens on the course.

Any attempt at hitting this green better be straight. Errant shots left will likely disappear in the fescue, and anything short-right will be swallowed up by the pond.


Options galore! Line and club selection are key off the tee on 5.

Esler designed great width in to the longer holes, generating a lot of options for how they can be played. This is the case on the par five sixth, the longest hole on the course tipping out at a beefy 618 yards.


Tee shot on the 600-plus yard par five 6th

The approach shot on the par five 6th.

By the green on six is where I noticed something little but interesting at Black Sheep: A new way of hiding trash cans. Rather than having the standard garbage cans near tee boxes, their refuse bins are buried in the ground with a pop-up button to step on that opens the lid.

Another Chicago-area course with a creative way of hiding otherwise unsightly on-course amenities is the Greg Martin designed Rich Harvest Farms. RHF buries their rakes near sand traps with a button that pops them up when needed… For whatever reason, I always enjoy seeing creative new ways of doing the mundane.

Because there are 27 holes, there is no true starting or finishing hole at Black Sheep. Instead there are three, and all three nines end with strong uphill layouts returning to the perched clubhouse.

A view of the ninth:

The eighteenth is my favorite of the finishing holes at Black Sheep. Climbing sharply uphill, the green is perched before the clubhouse and provides no visual of the ball landing. The approach has to carry the greenside bunkers and mounded front edge, so spin control is important.

The 27th is intimidating off the tee, with fescue that looks to encroach on the driving area from all directions. The fairways are wide, though, at Black Sheep, and the uphill approach shot is to the bottom section of the otherwise shared 2-acre practice putting green.


Just a sliver of fairway shows through shrouded tees on the 27th.

The thirteenth is the longest par three on the course at Black Sheep, tipping out at 241 yards.


The long par three 13th.

Maybe my favorite green complex on a course with tremendous greens is the putting surface on the par four 23rd. A double-ripple effect divides the green, twice, running from front-left to back-right, and the day’s pin location was just paces from the right edge.

85,Crooked Stick Golf Club,non100,"Carmel, IN",Pete Dye,1964,Hole-by-hole: Crooked Stick Golf Club,Bradley Klein,rev085_crooked_stick_1,"CARMEL, Ind. – Crooked Stick Golf Club is one of Pete Dye’s earliest gems and the course that put him on the map as an iconoclastic genius. Located 12 miles north of downtown Indianapolis in what used to be the sleepy farm community of Carmel, the course opened up in 1967 to rave reviews for its adaptation of classical-era design principles.

It took Dye three years of work to hew the low-lying site into golf ground. Halfway through, he and his wife, Alice, made a sojourn to Scotland where they witnessed for the first time steep-faced bunkers stabilized by railroad ties, fairways that dead-ended and greens whose contours defied the natural surrounds.

Here Dye drew upon the designers who most inspired him: Donald Ross, Alister MacKenzie and Seth Raynor. But he also added a unique Midwestern sensibility, including everything from knee-high prairie grasses, rocky streams, covered bridges and a railroad car. The result, as witnessed nationally during the 1991 PGA Championship, the 1993 U.S. Women’s Open, the 2005 Solheim Cup and the 2009 U.S. Senior Open, is a demanding yet enticing layout that emphasizes aerial strength, proper angles of approach, and a tolerance for crazy bounces.

For the 2012 BMW Championship the course will play to par-72, 7,497 yards long, with a 77.7 rating and a slope of 148.

No. 1, par 4, 358 yards
Dye, ever the curmudgeon, doesn’t believe in drivable par-4s. “That’s why they have par-3s,” he grouses. But he always has a short, delicate par 4 in the mix, though rarely as the opening hole. This one, somewhat over-treed down the right side and around the putting surface, calls for a layup to a narrow fairway and a short-iron to a very well protected green that’s segmented into two distinct pods on a right-to-left angle. Miss the proper pod and it’s a difficult putt to get to the other one.

No. 2, par 4, 442 yards
Dye is a great admirer of Ross’ Seminole Golf Club because of the need there to play shots both ways – a draw tee shot followed by a fade approach, and on the next hole the other way around. That’s exactly the principle in play at Crooked Stick, where after a light fade on the first hole you need to hit a long, powerful right-to-left tee shot, though even the longest hitters can’t carry the massive MacKenzie-like bunker that runs along the left side of the fairway to a distance of 335 yards off the tee. In typical strategic fashion, the ideal line is as close to the bunkers on the inside of the dogleg left as possible. From the fairway – one of eight that was narrowed over the winter in the landing area – it’s a fade approach to a narrow, elevated green that runs away from the player at the back.

No. 3, par 3, 195 yards
If you’ve ever wondered what Donald Ross on drugs would have designed, just stand on the tee here. Slightly uphill, with pop-up bunkers edging into the line of play on this kidney-shaped green. It’s accessible to a right-to-left shot, but anything running a tad long will quickly find sand, so distance control is crucial. Dye is convinced that PGA Tour players rarely miss on distance short or long; they just miss right or left, which is why so many of the greens here are narrow at the waist.

No. 4, par 4, 483 yards
The fairway landing area is at its narrowest at 300 yards, so keeping the drive in play and out of a handful of bunkers is crucial. On this long hole, it’s a fade drive and a draw approach to a green where it’s very easy to hang the ball out to the right and end up with a delicate up-and-over greenside recovery.

No. 5, par 5, 612 yards
A big, sweeping dogleg left, where the favorable angle off the tee on the right is littered with steep bunkers. With the prevailing wind out of the southwest, this hole plays down breeze over the right shoulder. Some players will reach the green in two, though holding the plateau and avoiding the Raynor-like steep falloffs around will be the difficulty. There’s a lot to be said for holding back on the second shot with a middle iron and coming at the green with full third shot that has control and spin on it.

No. 6, par 3, 201 yards
This hole is a paradigm of Midwest Americana, what with a farm pond lapping the right side of the green and a wooden, red-painted, covered bridge presiding over the back of the hole. There’s a cross ridge in the green that segments the front downslope from the back half of the green – where the slope feeds the ball right. The prevailing wind is from behind, which makes it harder to stay on the back right shelf when the hole is cut there and brings water more into play.


No. 7, par 4, 454 yards
Here’s the lull before the storm. Pretty straightforward, a left-to-right drive past an inconsequential fairway bunker on the right followed by a right-to-left middle iron to a fall-away green.

No. 8, par 4, 456 yards
Dye is a master of the break-neck dogleg; this one a hard left around the corner of a lake running along the entire inside of the hole. By suspending the target green over the horizon of the dominant hazard, he tempts strong players into playing an aggressive line when in a fact the smarter line is away; but good players hate turning their back on the flag and playing so far away. Here, it’s a right-to-left tee shot to a green with a bunker on the right and the surface tipped down to the water on the left. It actually sets up best for a perfectly controlled high fade – another example of how Crooked Stick demands you play both ways. More than any other hole on the course, the shift in structure makes you feel unsettled.


No. 9, par 5, 530 yards
This is one of those holes that John Daly, with his prodigious length during the 1991 PGA Championship, simply obliterated by driving over trees and the maintenance barn, leaving Dye in a quandary about how to test the new generation of long-ball hitters. He since has adjusted the hole so that there’s a huge bunker on the inside left of this dogleg that now requires a 305-yard carry to the sweet spot in the fairway. From there, the shot into the green of 200-plus yards has to thread a chute of trees and hold one of the smaller putting surfaces on the course.


No. 10, par 4, 397 yards
The back nine, on the south side of the property, kicks off with a modest-length hole where hitting the fairway is crucial thanks to water right and long pits of sand down both sides of the landing area. No drivers needed here, as a fairway wood or even a long iron will leave a short pitch left to a green with its high side right and a surface that cants steadily to the left. Once again, the ideal line off the tee is as close to the biggest trouble (on the right) along the fairway.


No. 11, par 5, 595 yards
This northbound par 5 plays with the prevailing wind over the player’s left shoulder and will likely yield some eagles. The hole actually starts with a new tee that creates a cross-over tee shot with Crooked Stick’s other par 5 on this nine, the 15th. The drive (to another one of those recently narrowed fairways) has to avoid a long, nasty collection of bathtub bunkers and potholes 250-350 yards off the on the left. A bold second shot into the low-lying green has to carry what looks like a cratered Sahara – this to a green canted on a diagonal that effectively shortens the depth of this well-protected green. The alternative, an option that Tour players hate, is to turn 30 degrees to the left and play a middle-iron into a dead-ended fairway and from there flip a wedge down along the more receptive main axis of the green.


No. 12, par 4, 424 yards
Dye is a genius at taking what most other architects would build as a straight hole and turning it into a confounding double-dogleg. The unbunkered fairway has a big kink in the lower right side – exactly where, from the tee, you mistakenly want to line up. The fairway forces you left, and from a draw stance you have to hit a shot that holds up against one of those steep fall-off, low-cut chipping areas that Dye – influenced by Pinehurst – occasionally relies upon.


No. 13, par 3, 182 yards
Only Dye would have the “chutzpah” (that’s a technical design term) to create a dogleg par 3, this one requiring a shot around a looming oak tree on the left. The tough part here is that this fall-away green sits near a creek that will gobble up approach shots hit short or a touch to the right.


No. 14, par 4, 497 yards
Here’s another of those holes that Daly eviscerated in 1991, turning what had been a strategic dogleg with a creek on the inside of the left elbow into a pitch-and-putt hole. The drive has since been toughened and lengthened, and because it plays into the prevailing breeze it’s not an automatic carry: 290 yards over the corner. Tug it a bit and you’re left in deep rough with a bad angle in; play it out to the right and you’re faced with an uphill approach of 200-plus yards to a green with steep bunkering flanking both sides up front and a surface that feeds everything to the left.


No. 15, par 5, 523 yards
Straight into the prevailing wind, this nominally short par 5 plays longer than it first looks. A massive, claw-like bunker runs the length of the left side of the landing area and cannot be outgunned, so drives have to steer clear because landing in it means a second shot blasted out wide right and short of the green. The target here, at 63 yards long, is far and away the biggest green on the course; also the most vexing, because it’s a MacKenzie-style wraparound surface, seen originally as the famed seventh at Crystal Downs Golf Club in Michigan and again as the 15th hole at another MacKenzie design that Dye has admired, the University of Michigan Golf Course. The banana-shaped green wraps around a mid-left-center bunker and is barely accessible from front to back by putting. The excitement comes when the only way to get a ball from the front lobe to the back is to clip it with a lob wedge. That makes for great theater, if a very upset green superintendent.

No. 16, par 4, 470 yards
Slightly downhill, decidedly downwind, and so the steep bunkers lining the fairways ending at 285 yards out can be readily passed. Here’s the most obvious example of a secret Dye trick: on all of his courses, his fairway bunkers are aligned to the front of the green and his greenside bunkers point to the back of the putting surface. The tough trick here is steering wide of a pond that laps the length of the green on the right – while avoiding a very deep bunker front left.

No. 17, par 3, 212 yards
If you ever want to renovate a Dye course, don’t hire Pete to do it. He never gets it right and loses his initial vision somewhat. He has tinkered with this hole endlessly at Crooked Stick, and it has acquired a harder, more aggressive shaping in the process as he deepens the greenside bunker on what amounts to your basic Redan hole: steep bunker left guarding the back left of a fall-away green. The wind here from the left on this exposed, elevated tee tends to push approaches to the right, leaving a delicate up-and-over recovery.

No. 18, par 4, 457 yards
You gotta love the suggestion box in the middle of the vast lake that laps the entire right side of this graceful dogleg right. Dye, who lives in a house left of the fairway, has been the club’s green committee of one for five decades and dutifully reads his mail. The sweep of this hole makes it very difficult to commit to a tee-shot line because there are no bunkers or trees for alignment. The approach shot has to deal with a bulk-headed green that sits low to the water and has three pot bunkers pulled back way to the left. If you’re in these, you have your hands full with the proverbial long bunker shot to a green that slopes into the water. The ideal line of play is a left-to-right drive and a right-to-left approach – tough shots to pull off under pressure."
86,Crooked Stick Golf Club,non100,"Carmel, IN",Pete Dye,1964,The Stick - Crooked Stick Golf Club,Jimmie Hames,rev086_crooked_stick_2,"On the morning of July 13, I took a crooked path to get to the Crooked Stick Golf Club.  I’d driven to Indianapolis from Erin, Wisconsin on the night before.  That morning I checked out of my hotel. I put Crooked Stick Golf Course in my GPS.  And off I went.  As I drove through the neighborhood approaching the Club, I started to get the feeling that I was heading to the wrong place.  As I arrived at the Crooked Stick Golf Course, it became very clear that this was not the Club that was ranked 94th on the Golf Digest 2017-18 Top 100 list.  I called Doug Hicks who had coordinated the round at the club with his brother Bob.  Bob is a member.  Doug provided me with the actual address of the club.

I put the club address into my GPS and was again on my way.  Problem solved.  So, I thought.  The GPS took me to the back of the club where there is no entrance.  Another phone call to Doug and a discussion with the Assistant Pro in the Golf Shop led to me arriving at the Club just minutes before our intended tee time.  I hit a couple of balls on the practice range with my driver before I headed to the first tee to join our group.  We were playing as a fivesome.  Doug’s brother had initially set us up to play with another member, Mike Kilkenny, because he didn’t think he would be available.  Fortunately, he could join us for the first 12 holes.  Doug’s youngest brother, Brian was the other member of our group of five. Jordan, our forecaddie introduced himself before he headed out to the fairway to track our tee shots. 

The first hole at the Crooked Stick Golf Club is a short par 4.  We played from the blue tees which measured just over 6650 yards with a slope of 73.3 and a rating of 135. The first hole was playing around 325 yards.  It has a generous fairway, but very little rough between the fairway and the trees that line both sides of that fairway.  The trees on the left are thick and come into play immediately if you hit your drive to the left.  The trees on the right are more spacious and forgiving. I hit my drive long, but to the right.  The ball was playable and only about 60 yards from the flag, with a small tree between it and the green. I could probably have easily cleared the tree with a lob wedge.  I was told however that it is customary to hit a second tee shot off the first tee if you miss the fairway.  My second drive on the first tee was just as long as the first, but it was down the middle of the fairway.

I didn’t take advantage of the generosity granted me on the first hole.  Oh yes, I did play the second drive rather than the first, I just shanked my approach shot from 60 yards out and ended up to the right of the green.  From there I chipped on and two putted for an opening hole bogey.

The second hole plays 385 yards.  It has a slight dogleg left and one of those customary long Pete Dye bunkers near the landing zone on the left side of the fairway.  Mike Kilkenny served as my guide for the day.  He was very knowledgeable of the course and offered great advice on where to hit my shots.  On the second hole, he advised that I hit down the right side of the fairway.  He pointed to a tree in the distance, just past where the fairway makes the slight left turn, as my target line.  I hit along that line and landed on the right side of the fairway with a nice angle to the flag, but the flag was tucked behind a small bunker on the right front of the green.

I missed the green on my approach shot, chipped to within five feet of the cup.  My par putt skimmed the left edge of the cup, but didn’t drop in.  I tapped in for a second bogey.  Two fairways hit and two missed greens.  Not a good start on the most playable course I’d faced all week.

The third hole is a medium arrange par 3. It’s the first of four par 3s on the course, but the only one without water.  It measures 170 yards to the middle of the green, but the pin was positioned on the back left portion of the green, so it was playing 180 yards.  I hit a 5 iron on a straight line to and then past the flag into the bunker behind the green.  It took me to shots to get out of the bunker and two putts to get the ball in the cup.  I was hitting the ball well at this point, but it wasn’t reflected in my score of two bogeys and a double bogey on the first three holes.

The fourth hole is a long par 4 measuring over 400 yards.  The fair way is lined with several small bunkers on both sides, but more on the right than the left.  Again, Mike gave me a nice line to hit my ball on and my drive found the fairway.  I hit my approach shot over the back of the green.  Again, I chipped on and two putted for another bogey.

The fifth hole is the longest of the four par 5s at Crooked Stick.  It plays 590 yards from the blue tees.  The fairway is narrow for the first 300 yards, then it widens before narrowing again for the last 130 yards before the green.  There are small bunkers along the right side of the fairway, right in the landing zone.  Mike pointed out that it was best to miss to the left.  In addition to avoiding the bunkers, it set you up for a lay up to the right side of the fairway, which has the best angle to the green.

I had my first missed fairway (this excludes my first drive on the first hole since I played my second drive which was in the fairway) when my drive rolled into the left rough. I hit a lay up to the left side of the fairway.  My approach landed in the right green side bunker.  I double bogeyed the hole.

The sixth hole is the signature hole at Crooked Stick.  It is a beautiful par 3 with water, a covered bridge and a big oak tree.  At least it had a big oak tree until a storm brought it down earlier in the week.  As you can imagine, this was a sad moment for the members and staff at Crooked Stick.  The storm also did additional damage to several other holes on the front nine. Following the storm, it wasn’t clear whether we would be able to play the course on Thursday.  Fortunately, the staff worked tirelessly to get the full 18 holes on the course reopened for the membership.  There were minor remnants of debris on the course, but nothing that interfered with play. 

What did interfere with my play was my poor swing on the sixth hole. I hit tee shot long and to the left of the green.  It took me 4 additional shots to hole out for a double bogey.  Doug on the other hand, hit his tee shot onto the green and sank a 60 foot putt for a birdie!

The seventh hole is a wide-open par 4 that plays just over 370 yards.  Mike again gave me a good line for my tee shot and I was able to find the fairway with my drive.  I landed on the left side of the fairway and had a great angle to the green.  I hit my approach shot to within five feet of the flag, but missed the birdie putt.  I settled for my first par of the round.

On the eighth hole, I tried to execute my drive according to Mike’s instructions, but hit a little too far to the right into the rough.  The eighth hole is a 400 yard par 4 with water along the left fairway all the way to the green.  You can understand why Mike advised that I hit my drive to the right side of the fairway.  My approach shot from rough sailed to the right and into the green side bunker. I hit out of the bunker, but just barely, so I didn’t make the green.  I chipped on and hit my customary two putts for a double bogey.

The ninth hole is a short but challenging par 5.  It plays less than 500 yards, but has a lot of trouble for each shot.  There is water along the left side of the fairway and a very large bunker in the landing zone.  The right side of the fairway has trees and the rough.  The creek that runs down the left side of the fairway, crosses the fairway at about 100 yards from the green.  The green side of the bisected fairway has timbers along the bank of the creek.

I hit a great drive on the hole to the middle of the fairway, just over 250 yards out.  I decided to go for the green in two.  This was a mistake.  My ball almost cleared the creek, but hit the timbers on the bank instead and bounced back into the water.  I could retrieve my ball, but that didn’t make up for the penalty stroke I took.  I hit my fourth shot onto the green to about 8 feet from the flag, but rather than putting for a birdie, I was putting to save par.  Had I laid up short of the creek, I could have saved at least one stroke and made an easy par.  Instead, I bogeyed the hole after missing the par putt.

The tenth hole is a medium distance par 4.  It plays 370 yards with water along the right side of the fairway and trees and bunkers along the left side.   I hit my drive way left.  It was far enough left that I had a clear shot to the green.  I missed the green to the left on my approach shot.  I then did what has been come a routine for me and that is chip or pitch on and two putt for bogey.

The 11th hole is a short par 5, measuring a little over 500 yards.  But don’t be fooled by it.  To take advantage of how short it is, you would need to hit a drive over a 5/4 domino of bunkers.  I call it that because there are two groups of bunkers clustered together.  The first group has four bunkers and the second group has five bunkers.  The group of five bunkers is arranged like the five dots on a domino.  It takes about a 240 yard carry from the blue tees to get past the bunkers.  I like dominos, so I took on the bunkers with my drive and landed the ball in the fairway.  This left me about 220 yards from the green.  Rather than thanking my lucky stars and playing it conservatively after that, I decided to take on the next set of bunkers between me and the green. This next set of bunkers consist of only two bunkers, but the first one is about 70 yards long.  If you get past it, there is a large green side bunker waiting.  Well those bunkers proved to not be a problem for me.  I hit my second shot into the fescue way right of the bunkers.  I turned great drive into a seven on my scorecard.

The twelfth hole is a par 4 that plays slightly longer than 400 yards.  It is shaped like a lazy “v”.  The fairway is narrow, but there is ample rough on the left and right if you miss the fairway.  I missed the fairway on the right.  My approach shot missed the green, but as usual, I chipped on and two putted for a bogey.

This had not been a good day for me on the par 3s.  The 150 yard par three thirteenth hole was no different.  While Pete Dye found a crooked stick in the corn field that would become the Crooked Stick Golf Club, I found a Crooked Creek several times on this day.  When Mr. Dye found his crooked stick, he imagined that could have been the way this game we called golf got started.  Perhaps some guy found a stick, decided to hit a rock with it, and then imagined what it would be like to hit that rock into a little hole in the ground.  Mr. Dye decided to change the name of the course he was designing from the originally planned name to Crooked Stick after finding that stick on the property.  I think I should consider calling it Crooked Creek for all the times I found the creek during my round. 

As you can imagine, the creek was in play on the 13th hole and I found it.  I made a double bogey on this par 3 as I had one on the previous two par 3s.

In 1991, John Daly was relatively an unknown in the golf world.  That changed when he won the PGA Championship by dismantling Crook Stick with his ability to hit the ball much farther than any other golfer in the field.  As we stood on the tee box for the fourteenth hole, Mike Kilkenny shared one the many John Daly stories that have become legend for that fateful contesting of the PGA Championship in 1991.

The 14th hole has a dogleg left that is designed to play almost 500 yards as a par 4 from the championship tees.  That crooked creek that I so admire, runs along the left side of the hole and bends with the dogleg.  It is about a 270 to 280 carry to cut the corner and reduce the hole to about a 400 to 420 yard hole from the championship tees.  John Daly was able to easily carry that creek.  While today with all the new technology and the fitness of the golfers, several golfers would be able to carry the creek, but in 1991, only John Daly could do it.  This meant that he could hit short irons or wedges on his approach shot to the green, while the other golfers were hitting long irons.

On this day while I was at Crooked Stick, given my experience with the crooked creek, I chose to avoid as much of the creek as I could.  I followed Mike’s advice to hit the ball to the right.  The hole plays only 420 from the blue tees.  I hit my drive through the fairway into the rough no the right side of the fairway, leaving about 180 yards to the green.  As was my pattern on par fours for the day, I left my approach shot short, pitched on and two putted for a bogey.

The fifteenth hole on the course is the final par 5.  It is a short par five playing only 485 yards from the blue tees. It is a straight forward hole.  The tee box points you toward a bunker along the left side if the fairway.  If you can avoid this bunker, the hole becomes an easy hole.  I avoided the bunker and hit the fairway with my drive, then laid up to about 70 yards.  I then hit the green in regulation leaving myself a makeable birdie putt of about 7 feet.  Unfortunately, the putt wasn’t so makeable for me.  I made par on the hole.

Th sixteenth hole is a straight away par 4 that plays slightly over 400 yards.  It has bunkers on the left and right as the fairway narrows at about 230 yards from the blue tees. I hit my best drive of the day on the 16th hole, leaving myself a nice angle in to the green which had a back middle pin.  The angle also helped to take the water along the right side of the green out of play.  There was a bunker on the right front of the green.  I took aim at the pin and landed on the left side of the green, short of the flag, setting up a nice birdie attempt.  I missed my birdie putt, but did make my second par in a row.

I approached the final par 3 on the course with some trepidation.  I had made double bogeys on the first three par 3s. Two of the first three had water in play.  The 17th hole had more water than the previous par 3s combined.  It protruded into the lake like a bridge across its southeast corner.  It was also playing as the longest par 3 of the course.  There was certainly a lot to think about as I prepared to hit my tee shot.  My tee shot landed 12 feet short of the flag and to the left.

With my ball, safely on the green of the final par 3 on the course, I took a moment to visit the lone tree that stood in the corn field that became the Crooked Stick Golf Course.  The tree is now a stump that serves as a base for the symbol of the course, a golf club with a crooked stick as the shaft.  There is also a plaque that lists the founding members of the course.  I tipped my hat to them for their contribution to the game of golf.


After visiting the stump, I made my way to the 17th green where my birdie putt awaited. I saw the line on the putt. It looked like it was breaking about 18 inches.  I was so confident that I’d make the birdie, that I asked our caddy Jordan to photograph the putt and make sure he caught the ball dropping into the cup.  What he caught was not a ball dropping into the cup, but rather a ball that move only about 6 inches of what I thought would be an 18 inch break. I made the second putt to record my third par in a row, but was disappointed in not making a birdie.

There we stood on the 18th tee box.  Another hole that was over 400 yards long with water in play. 


The lake that came into play on the par 3 seventeenth hole ran the length of the right side of the tee boxes, fairway, and green on the 18th hole.  I hit my tee shot into the lake.  Mike was kind and said I should re-tee because of my lack of familiarity with the course.  On my second tee shot, I didn’t want to go anywhere near that lake.  I hit my drive to the left and almost put my ball into the backyard of Pete Dye.  He still lives along the 18th fairway at Crooked Stick. 

The hole only got worse from there.  My approach shot flew the green and barely stayed in bound. I then left my third shot on the bunker.  I just picked up and wrote down a double bogey on my card.  It was an unceremonious end to a wonderful day of golf on a historic course with the Hicks brothers and Mike Kilkenny.

I would like to thank Doug for coordinating the round and both Bob and Mike for hosting us.  I’d also like to thank Brian for joining us for the round.  I will always remember that there was a man who found a crooked stick and built a wonderful golf course in its honor.

87,Bayou Oaks City Park,non100,"New Orleans, LA",Rees Jones,2017,"Bayou Oaks City Park (South) (New Orleans, Louisiana)",Brandon Wilde,rev087_bayou_city_1,"The Takeaway:  Bayou golf. The flat terrain is offset by some clever hole designs through the natural vegetation and water hazards. The archaic cypress and mossy oak trees make for some fantastic natural hazards.  Grade B-. What to Expect:  The South Course at Bayou Oaks was a pleasant surprise! This course was devastated by Hurricane Katrina and recently, in 2017, re-opened with a new design done by Mr. Rees Jones. As a city course I had low expectations, but I thoroughly enjoyed this track. The fairways were wide and the bunkers were soft. There were plenty of water hazards, but the course was very playable. The large century-old oak trees with Spanish Moss hanging off the branches give the course a mystical feeling. They are also strategically placed, making them significant hazards that necessitate some low-trajectory and well-shaped shots. The course also has programs that allow inner-city kids to learn the game that we all love so much. That is just one more reason why this course should be on your short list of courses to play in NOLA.
Individual Hole Analysis
Signature Hole:  9th Hole – 585 Yard Par 5 – Its not a terribly long hole, but with a water hazard in front of the tee box and a sand trap about 260 yards out it makes for an intimidating tee shot. A creek runs along the right side of the fairway, daring you to go big, but forcing you to play it safe. Your third shot around the green will give you a beautiful view of Old Glory flying just beyond the green. It’s a fantastic way to finish the front nine.
9th Hole at Bayou Oaks City Park (South) (585 Yard Par 5)
Best Par 3:  2nd Hole – 200 Yards – It doesn’t take long to get to the good stuff at Bayou Oaks. This hole is probably the most memorable of the course. A longish par three with water, sand, and a gorgeous oak guarding the safest entry point into the green. A high draw is the perfect play here to have a chance at a 2. However, there is quite a bit of fairway beyond the oak and in front of the green, so a miss short doesn’t take you out of contention for a par.
2nd Hole at Bayou Oaks City Park (South) (200 Yard Par 3)
Best Par 4:  16th Hole – 347 Yards – Don’t gamble to the left. A large water hazard plays along the entire left side of the fairway collecting all errant balls. Play out to the right, there’s more room there than you think. The smartest play is to play about 250 yards off the tee. That will keep you short of the sand and you’ll have less than 100 yards into the open right front aspect of the green. 16th Hole at Bayou Oaks City Park (South) (347 Yard Par 4)
Best Par 5:  11th Hole – 567 Yards – I’m a sucker for the wayward tree hanging out in the middle of the fairway. It just gives so much character to the golf hole. Again, Mr. Jones uses a large Oak as an obstacle that must be accounted for. The tree will come into play on the second shot and it is near impassable if you have a low-ball flight path. Play the shot nice and high over the tree; or play it safe and leave it to the right. 11th Hole at Bayou Oaks City Park (South) (567 Yard Par 5)
Birdie Time:  12th Hole – 373 Yard Par 4 – Another short par 4, but without the hazards one would normally expect on a hole of this length. There is water left, but there is so much room to the right that its not really in play. Grip it and rip it down the fairway, a 240 yard tee shot will clear the bunkers in the fairway, then nestle your approach nice and tight to the pin and tap in that birdie that you deserve! 12th Hole at Bayou Oaks City Park (South) (373 Yard Par 4)
Bogey Beware:  13th Hole – 471 Yard Par 4 – After the birdie on the previous hole, Bayou Oaks counters with a tester. This unassuming hole is tougher than it seems. With a sweeping dogleg left and water left keep your tee shot middle to right of the fairway. The approach is the difficult shot as the fairway narrows to a bottleneck at the green. Don’t be tempted to attack the pin if it is on the left side of the green. Play to the middle-right of the green. Par is a great score here. 13th Hole at Bayou Oaks City Park (South) (471 Yard Par 4)"
88,Bayou Oaks City Park,non100,"New Orleans, LA",Rees Jones,2017,Golf Course Review: Bayou Oaks at City Park - North Course,Kyle Hrubes,rev088_bayou_city_2,"After setting our schedule of where and when to do Golf Nola's golf course reviews this year I realized I have not done a Golf Nola review of the Bayou Oaks at City Park North Course. I made sure to get that done yesterday (1/4/24). 

This was also a different kind of review for the video. I decided to walk the golf course. Something I may not try again when doing an official Golf Nola review. Even though I think the video came out fine, I do not feel I was able to show as much of the golf course as opposed to when I use a golf cart. 

Outside of playing in scramble events, I have not played a regular stroke play round at Bayou Oaks North Course in several years. I played the golf course plenty as a junior and have fond memories on the golf course. It is actually the first course I ever shot under par on. Although that was back when it was a par 70 and the routing of the back 9-holes was different. It is still the same front 9-holes and it still brings back good memories. 

The North course at one point in time had the lowest green fee in the entire country at a rate of $8 to walk. Times have changed but the rate is still considered low. At only around $22+ tax to walk you can't go out and expect ""tour"" like conditions. However, the golf course is perfect for beginners, golfers who only play a few times a year, and those who either can't afford or don't want to pay more than $50 to play golf. It is also a short enough golf course to enjoy a round while walking at just under 5800 yards. 

As for the conditions, they were not bad based on the rate of the green fee. Actually, the conditions were pretty decent in some aspects. They were not consistent throughout the golf course but at the same time, there was some consistency. Only one green, hole number 9, had more grass on the green than any other. It still had a similar speed like the rest of the golf course but it was greener and had thicker grass on it. Perhaps because it is not as exposed to the colder north winds as much as the rest of the golf course. It also just looked healthier. 

Overall Rating: 2.5 out of 5

Tee Boxes: 2 out of 5

Don't let the 2 fool you into thinking the teeboxes were horrible. For the most part, they were decent with good amounts of grass on them for this time of year. Finding a decent area of grass was only difficult on one par 3. The main reason I give the tee boxes a 2 is that none of them are level. Some are worse than others and it is not just between the markers. The most level tee box was on hole number one. Just about every hole you had to consider a draw or a fade based on the ball being above or below your feet. 

Fairways: 2.5 out of 5

The fairways had a good amount of grass on them. They had some puddles on a few holes and many of the fairways were soft but the ball was not plugging. You didn't get much roll, if any, due to the recent rain but that was not much of an issue as far as playability. It was only an issue if you tried a bump and run shot. If you landed a ball short of the green on a few holes it would dig into the soft turf and not go much further. The biggest issue I had with the fairways was that I felt I was playing some sort of dodge golf. The fairways have a lot of dips in them that are borderline like potholes. If you play the ball down at all times like I do you could find yourself in the center of the fairway and your ball in a 4-inch depression. You can probably tell in the video the humps and bumps I was walking on trying to hold the camera steady. The grass was cut to a good height, even the crabgrass, and if you missed a depression you would have a decent lie. 

Greens: 2.5 out of 5

The speed of the greens was very good. The dormant grass gave them a speed that was quick but not overly quick. They were bumpy but had a good speed. There was a good amount of spike marks and unfixed pitch marks that could add to the bumpiness but sometimes if you caught those you could get a smooth roll. I found even when I fixed everything in my line the greens were just not smooth. Just like the fairways with depressions, it seemed many of the greens also had areas like that. On a much smaller scale but enough to make a difference when putting. Perhaps all the greens need is a day for maintenance to get out there and roll them and smooth them out. Putting was difficult when trying to judge a quick putt that may slow due to imperfections and not being smooth. However, I have played on worse greens and paid a higher green fee before. 

The bunkers were inconsistent. I played out of three total for the round and had three different experiences. One was near perfect, one was like playing out of clay and another was like hitting off of concrete. I know the recent rain could be a reason for the inconsistency. Maybe one didn't dry as fast, or maybe maintenance didn't get to prep them that morning, Plus a few did not have rake around them. 

I look forward to going back in the spring when the grass is fully grown back in and seeing what the conditions are like. Also, it is rumored that Bayou Oaks will be putting lights up on the North Course for night golf this year. Perhaps they will make some improvements to the course as well. Like leveling the tee boxes or getting the bunkers consistent. 

Again, for the rate it was worth it. The Bayou Oaks at City Park -North Course is great for introducing new golfers to the game. The North course can also be a good place for scratch golfers to challenge their game with the smaller greens and a few tight tree-lined holes, it requires some accuracy."
89,Bulle Rock,non100,"Havre De Grace, MD",Pete Dye,1998,"Bulle Rock (Havre De Grace, Maryland)",Bill Satterfield,rev089_bulle_rock_1,"The Takeaway:  Any argument that Bulle Rock isn't the top public course in Maryland is futile. In fact, in a state known for its exclusive private clubs, Bulle Rock stands up strong with even the best tracks in the state. The routing flows well, the holes are memorable, the course is challenging, and the conditioning is plush. All of these factors add up to a course that you shouldn't miss if you are in Baltimore, Philadelphia, or anywhere between.  Grade B+
What to Expect:  Plenty of upper end public courses claim to offer a country club experience for the day, but none delivers on that promise better than Bulle Rock. This northwest Maryland facility boasts multiple dining options, banquet and meeting rooms, and a full locker room staffed by an attendant waiting to serve you. The experience extends to the golf course where you are greeted by staff members at the bag drop, offered a GPS cart or a caddie for the day, directed to the complimentary driving range, and finally are able to go enjoy a course that features great conditioning. While many Pete Dye courses can feel a bit extreme and unorthodox at times, Bulle Rock instead feels like it belongs on the property as Pete let mother nature take a bigger lead in the design and the result was 18 attractive holes that are highly memorable and varied. The routing flows well which gives a nice continuity to the course and appeal to those that choose to walk. Elevation changes, some more severe than others, exist throughout the property which delivers some enjoyable shot making opportunities while not being too taxing on walking patrons. From the back tees the course will offer all of the challenge you want while the front tees do a great job of accommodating shorter hitters that may struggle with forced carries. The fescue lining the fairways can occasionally gobble up your golf ball and the difficulty of the course is significant enough to create some longer rounds, but overall the experience at Bulle Rock is top notch.
Individual Hole Analysis
Signature Hole:  18th Hole – 485 Yard Par 4 – In classic Pete Dye fashion, Bulle Rock goes out with a bang with this impressive par four. Water lines the entire left side of the fairway as players pray their snap hook doesnâ€™t come out to haunt them. A safe shot up the right side of the short grass will leave players with the best angle to the boulder supported green that fades toward the water and creates the most intimidating approach shot of the day. Rated as the most difficult hole on the back nine, the 18th is worthy of that notorious distinction.
18th Hole at Bulle Rock (485 Yard Par 4)
18th Hole at Bulle Rock (485 Yard Par 4)
Best Par 3:  12th Hole – 190 Yards – If you have played many Pete Dye courses then the look of this one-shotter will seem familiar, perhaps no more famously than at Whistling Straits. The hole wraps from left to right around the water with the green maintaining that angle along the hazard as well. When the pin is in the back right, like it was the day I played, then bold shots at the flag have a much more likely chance of finding the water, like mine did. The smart play is towards the back and left side of the green where the putting surface is largest and the most success can be realized. This hole may not be unique among Dye designs, but its effectiveness is what keeps bringing it back time and time again.
12th Hole at Bulle Rock (190 Yard Par 3)
Best Par 4:  13th Hole – 476 Yards – This is a great hole where Pete doesnâ€™t let you cheat it. Players trying to trim off yardage by contesting the right side of the hole where the fairway doglegs will almost surely be denied access to the fairway as their ball is repelled down a neighboring ravine. The entire hole slopes towards the ravine thus forcing the wise player to stay plenty left and deal with the lengthy approach shot into the green. The further left you can place your tee shot the more green depth youâ€™ll have to play with while tee shots to the right will have tons of width to play with but very little depth. The green is surrounded by four bunkers which makes the approach shot intimidating to those that fear the beach. It is worth noting that I pulled my approach shot into the railroad ties left of the green which promptly ricocheted my ball onto the putting surface two inches from the hole for the luckiest kick-in birdie of my life.

Best Par 5:  2nd Hole – 572 Yards – Many players will walk away from Bulle Rock with this hole being their favorite. Though the yardage is significant, this par five is reachable in two due to how far downhill it plays from the tee. Trees line both sides of the hole and a stream cuts through the fairway about 75 yards from the green which can create some trouble but the pot bunker in front of the green is where you can quickly make a fool of yourself trying to get out. This is likely the most attractive hole on the property and is the first â€˜wowâ€™ moment on the golf course.
2nd Hole at Bulle Rock (572 Yard Par 5)
Birdie Time:  3rd Hole – 177 Yard Par 3 – Clearly the best chance you have of scoring a birdie on any hole is one that you can easily reach in regulation. This short-to-mid length par three has a massive green that is easy to hit and will even welcome tee shots hung out to the right where they can quickly kick back onto the putting surface. The trees on either side of the green will help knock down the wind which combined with a perfect lie on the tee box should equate to an great opportunity to knock your approach shot stiff. Pick up a birdie here so that you have some insurance for later in the round where I assure you that youâ€™ll need it.
3rd Hole at Bulle Rock (177 Yard Par 3)
Bogey Beware:  5th Hole – 483 Yard Par 4 – This is a tough hole . . . a really tough hole. 483 yards is plenty of distance to cover, but you have to do it while the hole doglegs uphill between the trees and around a bunker to an elevated green with a slight false front. Players that think they can clear the bunker on the corner of the dogleg better be able to fly their ball 300+ yards uphill and risk finding the thick rough on the left. The long, skinny green resulted in two players in our foursome three-putting and was a quick reminder of how difficult this hole is from start to finish. Par here easily takes a stroke on the field.

Hole Descriptions: Amongst well-known architects with numerous top courses, Pete Dye is unique in that many of his top designs are available to the general public. I’ve always appreciated this about him and have been fortunate to play a number of his best courses for this reason. Bulle Rock had always been on my radar given its frequent status on Top 100 lists, reputation among Maryland public courses, and the fact that it’s an easy day trip from most Northeastern cities. I finally had the chance to play and certainly came away with an appreciation for the course. While Bulle Rock cannot compete with the likes of Dye’s Whistling Straits, Kiawah, or even Harbour Town due to their settings, it is your typical Dye championship layout, offering an excellent challenge with a strong routing and sterling conditions. The features that immediately stood out to me following my round are the course’s undulating terrain which creates many sidehill lies and its narrow greens, which make for difficult approaches from the wrong side of the fairway. With excellent rates and its history as an LPGA venue, Bulle Rock is arguably the best public option nearest to Philadelphia, Washington D.C., and Baltimore. I highly recommend it.

Pete Dye is sympathetic at the start with a 335 yard slight dogleg left par 4. This hole features a right-to-left sloping fairway lined by a prominent bunker down the right at 225 yards and two down the left at 170 and 230 yards. Driver isn’t needed here and might get you into trouble, as numerous small bunkers guard short of the green on either side. Like many greens at Bulle Rock, this putting surface is narrow and primarily runs right-to-left. This is probably the most boring hole on the course as well as the easiest – don’t lose a shot here.

The par 4 1st
The 2nd is one of Bulle Rock’s signature holes as an excellent 555 yard par 5. With the entire hole in view from an elevated teebox, this hole begins with a severely downhill teeshot to a left-to-right sloping fairway lined by OB right the entire way. I found this teeshot to be visually intimidating, but there’s plenty of room down the left provided you can’t reach a left bunker around 300 yards. The golfer is left an interesting choice on their second shot, with a small creek running through the fairway about 90 yards short of the green. There is some fairway on the other side of this creek, but I don’t see the benefit of aiming for it unless you think you can reach the green. This green is elevated, runs back-to-front, and is guarded by deep bunkers short and right with several small pot bunkers long. Despite it being a par 5, there’s lots of room for disaster here.

The par 5 2nd is a gorgeous hole
19121932-F429-4497-A2B1-342317888D72
The approach at 2
The 3rd hole is Bulle Rock’s first and shortest par 3 at 156 yards. Somewhat reminiscent of some of the par threes at Dye’s Blackwolf Run, this hole is most notable for a large tree that overhangs the right side of the green and blocks a right-to-left shaped shot. Even more danger exists left and long, with a severe drop off, numerous bunkers, and fescue. This excellent green is narrow and plays somewhat like a Redan.

070AC41C-57B2-4CEF-BE34-D5258305935F
The par 3 3rd
The 4th hole is one of the stronger par fours on the course playing as a 380 yard dogleg right. Featuring a teebox hidden in the back right trees, a power cut is the preferred play off the tee. This entire fairway slopes left-to-right and is guarded by giant bunkers on either side beginning around 225 yards. This approach plays slightly uphill to a narrow, long green defended by bunkers on either side and a creek to the right.

The sleek par 4 4th
At 405 yards, the 5th hole is a very difficult par 4 deserving of its number 1 handicap. A dogleg left playing severely uphill on the approach, this hole begins with a short forced carry over a creek to a generous fairway defended by a large bunker on the left side of the dogleg around 220 yards. Longer hitters need to be wary of a bunker on the other side of the dogleg at about 270 yards. This approach then runs at least one club uphill towards yet another narrow, right-to-left sloping green lined by numerous small bunkers on either side. Par is an excellent score here.
The lengthy par 4 5th
The 5th green
After some difficult holes, the 6th is a fun hole and one of my favorites on the course as a 387 yard par 4. This teeshot plays semi-blind and straight downhill towards a sloping fairway defended by numerous bunkers down the right. A creek marks the end of this fairway at about 310 yards and must be carried to another small, narrow green that runs slightly left-to-right and is defended by a giant bunker right.
The par 4 6th
The approach at 6
At 175 yards, the 7th hole is technically Bulle Rock’s longest par 3 but I think the 12th plays longer most days. This is a nice one-shotter running slightly uphill towards a well-defended green featuring multiple plateaus, four bunkers short right, and a small pot bunker left.
The par 3 7th
The par fives at Bulle Rock are an extremely strong collection and the 481 yard 8th hole is my favorite of the group as a dogleg left beautifully laid out in front of you. Essentially playing as a Cape, fescue lines the entire left side of this hole, forcing golfers to choose their line carefully. Large bunkers down the left at 250 yards and right at 300 yards mark the start of the dogleg. From here, the fairway runs slightly uphill and progressively narrows with thick rough right and numerous bunkers and fescue down the left. This right-to-left sloping green is guarded by two deep bunkers left.
The par 5 8th
The 9th hole is a dramatic and interesting dogleg right par 4 at 418 yards. One of the most difficult holes on the course, this teeshot is extremely intimidating with water directly in front of you and an 170 yard carry to reach the far left portion of fairway. The ideal line takes on this water and requires a carry of at least 220 yards over a trio of bunkers as well. This entire fairway slopes severely left-to-right and makes for a difficult approach to a small green defended by bunkers on either side.
The golfer has numerous (but few appealing) options on the 9th teebox.
Notice a small portion of fairway to the far right longer hitters could perhaps reach
The back 9 is the longer of the two sides at Bulle Rock but begins with an easier hole in the 373 yard par 4 10th. A dogleg left that turns around 270 yards, this hole initially plays straight over a plateau to a fairway lined by numerous bunkers left and fescue to the far right. This green is again narrow and quite undulating defended by bunkers on either side.
The par 4 10th
The approach at 10
At 596 yards (and 665 from the Blacks!), the 11th hole is the longest at Bulle Rock as a true marathon, three-shot par 5. I counted nearly 20 bunkers on this hole alone, the closest thing to Whistling Straits here. This fairway is initially a slight dogleg left guarded by bunkers on either side around 220 yards and fescue to the right. It then runs downhill and narrows considerably with a set of five bunkers down the right about 190 yards short of the green. This green most notable for its right swale is defended by numerous pot bunkers on either side and a large bunker right. Despite getting five shots to work with, a par here is not disappointing.
The par 5 11th
The approach at 11
The 12th hole is arguably Bulle Rock’s signature hole as a 174 yard par 3. A classic Dye template and near carbon copy of Blackwolf Run’s 4th, this hole features water down the right you’ll have to carry the entire way if you want to take a straight line to this green. Three bunkers guard left and must be popular bailouts for those afraid of getting wet. This green contains some tricky pins with multiple plateaus.
The par 3 12th is an awesome hole
A worthy number 2 handicap, the 13th hole is a difficult 428 yard dogleg right par 4. Featuring a tight fairway that turns right around 260 yards, you absolutely cannot miss right here with a large bunker at 160 yards and a valley of rough and OB afterwards. After a good drive, the golfer is left a difficult approach to a small, left-to-right sloping green defended very effectively by deep bunkers short and on either side.
The par 4 13th requires both accuracy and power
The approach at 13
At 331 yards, the 14th is the shortest par 4 at Bulle Rock and offers a chance to get a shot back after some tough holes. A downhill, semi-blind, slight dogleg right, this fairway is generous down the left but features bunkers right the entire way. At about 280 yards, this fairway narrows to essentially nothing with bunkers on either side. This approach plays as much as a club less towards another small, narrow green defended by several bunkers on either side.
The fun par 4 14th
The approach at 14
The 551 yard 15th is the final par 5 on the course and is one of the more interesting holes here. Featuring a split fairway, this teeshot is fairly straightforward and must play down the right to an uphill generous fairway that ends around 260 yards with a bunker down the left as well. From here, the golfer must carry a creek to access the second portion of the fairway to the left. Good teeshots will be rewarded with a possible heroic shot to reach this green in two. This green is extremely long and narrow and runs back-to-front.
The par 5 15th
The second shot at 15 gives the golfer options
The 16th hole plays similarly to the 6th as a 387 yard par 4 running severely downhill. This hole is pretty straightforward with bunkers down the right at 210 and 270 yards and trees left. This green again requires precision, playing very narrow with four bunkers and a mound down the left and a singular bunker right.
The par 4 16th
The 17th is a 160 yard par 3 and is perhaps the easiest hole at Bulle Rock. While not a bad hole, it is rather forgettable and feels somewhat cheap coming so close to the end. Playing level, this hole features a large green with numerous plateaus defended by bunkers on either side.
The par 3 17th
At a strong 459 yards, Bulle Rock saves one of its most memorable holes for last with the par 4 18th. Playing downhill, this tough hole features water down the left the entire way while the right is defended by a bunker at 310 yards and a large tree at 225 yards. This is probably the most intimating approach on the course, with water wrapping around an undulating green left and long and a bunker long right.
The par 4 18th
The approach at 18
A side view of the 18th green and clubhouse
General Comments: Bulle Rock features an upscale clubhouse and excellent practice facilities, with a full grass range and nice short game area near the clubhouse. Pace of play was average when I played. The course is named for the first thoroughbred horse brought to the U.S. from England.
Bulle Rock’s range is better than most private courses
Verdict: While not Pete Dye’s most memorable design, Bulle Rock is an excellent, affordable, and challenging upscale layout that rightfully earns its reputation as one of the top public courses in the region."
91,Tullymore Golf Course,non100,"Standword, MI",Jim Engh,2002,"Tullymore Golf Course (Stanwood, Michigan)",Bill Satterfield,rev091_tullymore_1,"The Takeaway:  One of Jim Engh's higher acclaimed courses, Tullymore boasts Engh's brazen style with muscle bunkers, punchbowl greens, and loads of risk/reward options. The extreme nature of the design would be difficult to enjoy on a daily basis, but is well worth a visit in Michigan.  Grade B-
What to Expect:  Jim Engh is one of those architects you either ""get"" or you don't. He has perhaps the most unique design style in golf which seems to instantly appeal to players or repel them. His individual style certainly caught the attention of raters at Golf Digest that put Tullymore in its Top 100 Golf Courses in America rankings, and even after falling off that list, it held in for over 10 years on the Top 100 Public Courses in America list. When players tee it up at Tullymore there are a few features they will instantly notice; the long squiggly bunkers that Engh refers to as ""muscle"" bunkers, the green sites that are often depressed into a punchbowl with long grass on the face, and the number of forced carries over wetlands. Of those features, it is the greens that provide the most interest and drama throughout the round with a ton of creativity needed to navigate them effectively. The 75.2/150 rating and slope from the tips is a stout test for a course that measures 7250 yards and you'll find that the challenge never lets up from the 1st tee to the 18th green. The back nine is the better of the two sides and the par fives stand as the highlight of the course with great risk/reward opportunities where Jim rewards the bold play more often than the conservative one. It certainly isn't a course you'd walk, so cart golf is the call of the day with a routing that favors dramatic holes more so that continuity in the flow. I don't know if I own enough golf balls to make this my home course, but it is certainly worthy of an annual visit if you reside in the Midwest.
Individual Hole Analysis
Signature Hole:  18th Hole – 535 Yard Par 5 – The 18th at Tullymore reflects so much of what Jim Engh brings to his designs with a hole that is fun to play, features a risk/reward element, and will keep you thinking about strategy from tee to green. The tee shot plays at an angle to the fairway where a pond runs the full length of the left side. A successful tee shot will set up a decision on whether to challenge the green with a second shot that needs to carry water the full length of distance to the green. From this angle, the green is very wide but quite shallow and features a muscle bunker running up the water line before bending in front of the green on a line that will cause havoc for players going for it in two. Laying up to the right on the second shot will be no walk in the park as two trees soar from the edge of the water hazard and can inhibit the line you want to take into the green. Behind the green is a hillside that can be utilized to bail out to, but this is the type of hole where you are presented with challenges and opportunities on each stroke and Jim is going to require commitment from you in order to be successful.
18th Hole at Tullymore Golf Course (535 Yard Par 5)
Best Par 3:  12th Hole – 257 Yards – The 12th is a lengthy one-shotter that plays into a bowled green, which on its own wouldn’t be overly unique, however Engh doesn’t stop there. A hill on the left side blocks the view of the left 3⁄4 of the green and creates a blind shot into many of the pin locations with just the tip of the flag often being in view. Attempting to hit a big cut into the green will require carrying the trees that loom on the left side whereas hitting a draw can be an ideal way to find the opening into the green and utilizing the spin and ground to work tee balls near the flag. It is fun, challenging, perhaps peculiar, and 100% Engh.
12th Hole at Tullymore Golf Course (257 Yard Par 3)
Best Par 4:  10th Hole – 458 Yards – I really enjoyed starting the back nine with a classic risk/reward dogleg right par four. The tee shot plays straight away with a creek meandering along the left side and a lone tree protecting the corner while the right side offers a hill to help keep balls in play. Bailing to the right results in an angle on the approach where the water on the left is a bigger factor while players coming from the left side of the fairway can be more aggressive with their second shot given the room to miss right or long. At this point in the round you should know if you are feeling better about your drives or iron game and can decide which strategy to employ to come out successful.
10th Hole at Tullymore Golf Course (458 Yard Par 4)
Best Par 5:  16th Hole – 608 Yards – The 16th features elements of a classic par five design that Engh is prone to employing, though this hole plays longer than most of its cousins. The tee shot is fairly nondescript as it plays towards a flattish fairway with trees lining each side, but then things start to get interesting with the second shot. The fairway bends to the left around a pond and players are presented with a decision on whether to cut a chunk of yards off by hitting over the marsh on a straight line to the green or whether to lay up on the right side where a series of hillocks line the outside of the short grass. A lengthy muscle bunker winds along the low ground between the water and fairway with its last leg pushing towards the green and sitting on a direct line with player’s shots who try to get home in two. In match play, this is a great hole for players to decide whether to play aggressively or whether to dial back and just make par.
16th Hole at Tullymore Golf Course (608 Yard Par 5)
Birdie Time:  3rd Hole – 317 Yard Par 4 – Perhaps the most unique hole on a course classified by uniqueness, the 3rd is a confounding design that will have you questioning your strategy each loop around, but ultimately, yields an opportunity to card a birdie as well here as anywhere on the course. This short hole features two oversized trees whose branches impede the air over the ideal landing zone of a drive. Laying back short of them will almost certainly require you to try to finagle a shot through them or perhaps over them. Though more times around Tullymore could convince me otherwise, the best strategy appears to require a drive that carries the tree on the left and opens up a great angle to attack the flag from with the green featuring a shallow bowl effect that will work balls towards the center of the putting surface. Of course the best play of all is bombing a drive straight at the green, but the muscle bunker in front can be a deadly spot to be. No matter how you attack this hole, its short length should yield an opportunity to score with and perhaps make up for any failures on the previous hole.
3rd Hole at Tullymore Golf Course (317 Yard Par 4)
Bogey Beware:  2nd Hole – 481 Yard Par 4 – Jim expects you to have warmed up before your tee time because he is going to throw his most difficult test at you with the sophomore hole. At 481 yards and nowhere to cut yardage off, players need to bomb a drive before setting up a lengthy approach into the green that is bowled on the right but falls off on the left. A heavy tree line flanks the left side and will encourage players to hit up the right side, however approaches from the right result in an inferior angle to the green that can make finding it in regulation challenging. Players that carve a drive up the left side will increase their chance of getting to the green in two, but the penalty for missing left is severe. Par or better here should put a giddy-up in your step moving forward.

92,Tullymore Golf Course,non100,"Standword, MI",Jim Engh,2002,Tullymore Golf Club Review – A Return To Tullymore,The Original Golf Blogger,rev092_tullymore_2,"I first published a Tullymore review some seven years ago and thought it was one of the best courses I had played. After playing it again recently, my appreciation for Tullymore has only increased.
Tullymore is a superb test of golf, offering players a wide variety of strategic decisions. On any given hole  players have a number of choices off the tee, and then even more as they approach the green. Architect Jim Engh’s design lets a player find his or her own way (assuming a correct tee selection), without being forced into a particular style of play.
I generally play a conservative game, placing a premium on finding a fairway at whatever distance. On the approach, I leave room for error on the short side, trusting in a ground game, pitching balls at the green and letting them roll toward the hole. Tullymore rewards that style of play. But if you’re of the bomb and gouge mindset, that will play well, too.
Such a design, I have found, is rare. Architects quite understandably favor a particular kind of play (if only subconsciously) and incorporate that into their layouts.  Design bias is why it is possible for two golfers to play a course, and at the end of the day one likes it and the other does not.  A design’s ability to appeal to all sorts of players and styles is rare, and is the difference between a good and a great course.
Tullymore is a great course.
The scenery and setting at Tullymore are beautiful, taking advantage of wood, marsh, meadow and elevation changes. The entire layout looks unforced and natural. My impression is that Engh “found” the holes, rather than “built” them. For example, on the front nine, there are three par threes in a four hole stretch. That’s unusual. Once you see the holes, however, you realize that Engh seized exactly what the land offered. The back nine, on the other hand, has three par fives. Again, the holes fit the landscape perfectly.
Tullymore’s conditioning is top notch. I played just a couple of days before the Tullymore Classic, a Symetra Tour tournament, and was hard pressed to find anything out of place.
Tullymore is a bit out-of-the-way in Canadian Lakes, Michigan. But I think it is worth a trip, especially if you stay overnight in one of the resort’s many rooms, and play the sister course, St. Ives (review here).
For my own part, I can’t wait to get back to Tullymore for another round."
93,Hazeltine National Golf Club,non100,"Chaska, MN",Robert Trent Jones Sr.,1962,Hazeltine National,Bill Satterfield,rev093_hazeltine_1,"The Takeaway:  A course designed with the prime purpose of attracting championship golf, Hazeltine has done just that by hosting virtually every major USGA and PGA event. The course is straightforward in its approach and offers little inspiration from an architectural perspective, except for the top shelf 10th and 16th holes, but rather is one of the stoutest tests in the country.  Grade B+.
What to Expect:  A course with a steep tradition in championship golf, Hazeltine National is the go-to location for the USGA and PGA when it comes to hosting an event in Minnesota. Hazeltine quickly became known across the country when it hosted the U.S. Open just eight years after opening. However, it was more of a rise to infamy than it was a rise to fame as the course took verbal abuse from the players in the 1970 U.S. Open when nearly half the field didn’t break 80 on the first day. Located west of Minneapolis, Hazeltine is located on gently rolling terrain and features a design built to test the best players in golf while boasting over 100 bunkers throughout the routing. Renovated in preparation of the 2016 Ryder Cup, the brilliant white sand in the bunkers is both striking and fantastic to play from. In addition, the conditioning of the course is top notch with firm fairways and beautifully rolling greens that give you exactly what you deserve. While the test at Hazeltine is solid, the architecture lacks creativity with the 10th and 16th holes being the only compelling offerings; but they pack some serious punch and rank as two of the best holes in the state. Players are given the option to ride a cart if they wish but walking is encouraged, especially with the caddie program the club offers in an effort to stay true to the roots of the game. In the end, Hazeltine National is a worthy experience considering its tournament history lacks the compelling architecture to be considered amongst the elite courses in the country.
Individual Hole Analysis
Signature Hole:  16th Hole – 402 Yard Par 4 – Not only is the 16th the signature hole of Hazeltine National, it is arguably the signature hole for all of Minnesota. This two-shotter capes to the right around Hazeltine Lake while an outlet stream carves down the left side. The peninsula green pours fear in the hearts of unconfident golfers but the putting surface opens up to the center of the fairway so there is little reward for challenging the lake on the right too much. There are no bunkers to contend with but there is also very little forgiveness around the green so you have to be spot on with your approach. This is a beautiful hole and one you can score well on if you don’t get too greedy.
16th Hole at Hazeltine National Golf Club (402 Yard Par 4)
Best Par 3:  8th Hole – 166 Yards – The distance shouldn’t be intimidating but the surrounds can be on this intriguing one-shotter. A pond sets the boundary for the front and right sides of the green while two bunkers hug the left and a single bunker blankets the back of this modest sized putting surface. A back right pin is the sucker location while anything on the left half should have you pinseeking.

Best Par 4:  10th Hole – 424 Yards – If the 16th hole didn’t get so much hype, the hole you would always hear about at Hazeltine is the 10th. This bold par four features an unassuming tee shot to a landing area that is only partially in view and is flanked by a trio of bunkers on the left and a single bunker on the right. The fairway then doglegs hard left and plummets 35 feet to a green set against Hazeltine Lake. Every corner of the green is protected with sand or water so the only safe route to the putting surface is through the air or a tumbling shot through the opening in the center of the green. The approach shot on this hole offers the most impressive views at all of Hazeltine.

Best Par 5:  7th Hole – 572 Yards – The double dogleg 7th forms a reverse 'S' shape and gives players a risk/reward proposal to consider. The unassuming tee shot features a pair of fairway bunkers on the left side and asks for a baby cut shot that follows the turn of the short grass. The fairway then travels towards the green with a slight turn back to the left at the end as it terminates at the pond imposing the front of the green. Some fairway is offered on the right side to work a ball in but if you don't play it just right you may end up in one of the three bunkers waiting outside the first cut. Players that can fly the ball to the green or have confidence in hitting the 15 yards strip of fairway leading into the putting surface can take their chances at reaching this green in under regulation and hopefully gaining a stroke back on the field. If you go long there is some recovery room from some longer grass so you definitely want to take the longer club if you are in doubt on which stick to pull.
7th Hole at Hazeltine National Golf Club (572 Yard Par 5)
Birdie Time:  14th Hole – 352 Yard Par 4 – The short 14th is a reprieve from the beating of long holes that Hazeltine is well known for and an opportunity to throw a birdie on the card if you haven't been able to yet. A 30 yard long bunker flanks the right side of the fairway and asks players to layup short of it or take their chances bombing past it where the fairway opens up again. Players hitting past it need to avoid the bunker positioned 35 yards short of the front edge of the green on the left side to set themselves up for a simple pitch into the putting surface. The green is a fairly generous target for a hole this short so go flag hunting here and give yourself a short putt for birdie; you're going to want the insurance heading into the next hole.
14th Hole at Hazeltine National Golf Club (352 Yard Par 4)
Bogey Beware:  15th Hole – 642 Yard Par 5 – Nearly 100 yards different in length between the Blue tees and one set up at the Gold tees, the 15th is a bear when you are tipping it out at Hazeltine. A total of 14 bunkers come into play on this hole; more than double the total number of bunkers on my home course entirely. With nine of the bunkers being found on the left side of the hole one would think that staying to the right would be the safest play, however out of bounds lines the entire right side as this portion of the property abuts a housing development and will cost you stroke and distance if you put it in someone's backyard. This is a long and methodical hole with little opportunity to cut distance off and a small climb to the green at the end of your trek. You may suffer a bogey here, but the view of Hazeltine Lake and the surrounding area from this green may be worth it.

It has stood host to every important US golf tournament; US Open, PGA Championship, US Senior Open, US Women’s Open, and the US Amateur. And now it will host the Ryder Cup.

The course was designed by Robert Trent Jones Sr. and first opened for play in 1962. Host to several US Open Championships, it sometimes got criticized for being too difficult on windy days, culminating in some changes. The changes were well received, and a slew of major championships followed. The course continues to develop, now under the guidance of Robert Trent Jones’ son, Rees Jones, who has upgraded the course by adding new tees and repositioned some sand traps, all to maintain the challenging nature of the course in light of ever improving golf equipment.

The course follows Robert Trent Jones philosophy; reward brave shots well executed and punish poor ones, while always offering a safe alternative to avoid risk-taking. In other words, tempt the brave to take risks to win tournaments.

Clubhouse
The club house has all you can wish for, and some of it you can even buy, at very reasonable prices, in the proshop. Also don’t miss all the history lining the walls on the way to the restaurant. If you have a chance, try to get up on the rooftop balcony, which offers a great view of the course, with downtown Minneapolis visible in the distance on a clear day.Ryder Cup display in the clubhouse.
So can you play Hazeltine? Not really, it is a private club. But on Mondays it is open for charity and corporate events. So if you work for the right company you may have a chance to get a tee time. If you do, you’re in for a treat.
Already on the first hole, you realize that this is not an easy course.

Even if you make the green in regulation, you’ll be faced by a difficult putt if you’re not on the right level. This continued to be true on many holes, especially the fourth hole.

After some rest on the second hole, the third hole, a par five, had index one. Even the pros need three to reach the green, with a difficult approach to an elevated and very undulated green. One of my personal favorites on the course. At the fifth hole, bunkers are the main complication. On hole six, one of the most beautiful (especially if you live in one of the villas by the green) you get the first taste of water. And so it continues.

On the back nine, you get down to Hazeltine Lake already on the 10th, , the most scenic of all the holes, and you soon reach one of the hardest holes on the course, number twelve. With a new tee 50 yards back and a pond guarding the green, for the pros this is a real challenge.

On the 16th, you drive over Hazeltine Lake. As if that wasn’t difficult enough, if you drive too far you end up in a creek. Johnny Miller called this hole “probably the hardest par four I ever played”. But if you play from one of the more forward tees, it is doable for all players.

The course finishes as it opened, with a three-tiered green, letting the greenkeeper make the hole as difficult as the tournament demands. A great setup."
95,Fallen Oak Golf Club,non100,"Saucier, MS",Tom Fazio,2006,"Fallen Oak Golf Club (Saucier, Mississippi)",Bill Satterfield,rev095_fallen_oak_1,"The Takeaway:  The ""Shadow Creek of the South,"" Fallen Oak is MGM's high roller offering north of the gaming town of Biloxi, Mississippi. While not in the same league architecturally as Fazio's effort with its sister course in Las Vegas, Fallen Oak delivers the same exceptional service and conditioning to create the most envied golf experience in the Magnolia State.  Grade B+
What to Expect:  The high roller golf course of MGM's Beau Rivage Resort and Casino, Fallen Creek is modeled after another Steve Wynn project; Shadow Creek in Las Vegas. Like Shadow Creek, Fallen Oak was designed by Tom Fazio as an oasis removed from the glitzy lights of a gambling town. Both courses offer similar experiences including a limo ride from their respective hotel, personalized name plates in the locker room, celebrity name plates next to yours, immaculate conditioning, caddies, and often more employees on property then there are golfers. Fazio had less to work with on North Las Vegas’ barren desertscape but employed more imagination to create a course that is more compelling to play than Fallen Oak. That isn’t to say Fallen Oak isn’t good, because it clearly is, it just doesn’t live up to the lofty standard of its older brother. Fallen Oak is solid from start to finish, as you’d expect with Fazio, with the front nine offering the more engaging hole designs of the two sides, although the signature 18th is easily the best hole on the entire property and the best finishing hole in the Magnolia State. In fact, the course gets its namesake from this hole where a large oak tree, which is partially fallen, sits on the right side of the driving zone and was commonly used as a meeting spot when Fazio’s crew was constructing the course. The back nine features more movement in the terrain than the front nine but is also routed through denser trees, so getting wild off the tee gets punished quicker. Speaking of tee shots, the bunkering throughout the course is deep and can be a real nemesis off the tee where several bunkers impinge the driving zones. In the end, Fallen Oak clearly offers the best golfing experience in Mississippi which certainly contributes to its lofty rankings on magazine lists, but architecturally it takes the silver medal to the newer Gil Hanse designed Mossy Oak course up in West Point.
Individual Hole Analysis
Signature Hole:  18th Hole – 493 Yard Par 4 – Quite easily the best hole on the course, the 18th also makes an argument as the most difficult. The course’s namesake comes from the partially fallen oak tree located right of the fairway and can be reached with a long tee shot. Going left off the tee doesn’t provide any safety as a trio of bunkers await on that line and require players to stripe one down the short grass for any hope of reaching the green in regulation. The left side continues to provide a challenge enroute to the green with a pond and large bunker flanking that side of the putting surface while a small bunker sits near the front right. With a non-scoring club in your hand, some players may elect to just layup and take their chances at getting up and down rather than assuming the risk of a lengthy approach which could yield a big number if things don’t go well. The way the hole bends left and swoops down to the green next to the glistening water pair with the artistic bunkering creates a beautiful setting to play golf.
18th Hole at Fallen Oak Golf Club (493 Yard Par 4)
Best Par 3:  3rd Hole – 224 Yards – A crescent par three wrapping to the left around a pond where the further you tee it back, the more carry you have to achieve to clear the water. The green angles away from the player and affords the most forgiveness on the right side, so if you are between clubs and choose to stomp on the shorter club, don’t even think about attacking a flag on the left side. Both par threes on the front (3rd and 8th holes) play over the water so you need to avoid going short at all costs.
3rd Hole at Fallen Oak Golf Club (224 Yard Par 3)
Best Par 4:  10th Hole – 468 Yards – The back nine starts with a very strong two-shotter that will test even the best of players. Large bunkers are found on each side of the driving zone so there is minimal forgiveness afforded off the tee before players find themselves staring at an uphill approach shot. The center of the green is fronted by a bunker and pushes players away from the heart of the putting surface which makes hitting this green in regulation all the more difficult. Reprieve is afforded up the left where the fairway tumbles in from this side and can help move approach shots onto the green. It takes two very good shots to have a look at birdie, so pat yourself on the back if you can manage a par here.
10th Hole at Fallen Oak Golf Club (468 Yard Par 4)
Best Par 5:  13th Hole – 575 Yards – The 13th features a design element that I really like; a dogleg that bends one way while the fairway slopes the opposite direction. In this case, the fairway slowly and steadily bends to left the whole way while the terrain tilts to the right. Bunkers protect left side of the hole in case people try to cheat the distance and attack the dogleg while a pair of bunkers await 75 yards from the green on right side to challenge the layup zone. Getting home in two requires a shot up the left side that fades over to the safe side of putting surface. The uphill approach provides one of the more visually appealling shots on the course as well as challenging given the limited view of the green.
13th Hole at Fallen Oak Golf Club (575 Yard Par 5)
Birdie Time:  7th Hole – 330 Yard Par 4 – Time to get aggressive. Despite the water that flanks the right side of this hole, the 7th delivers an opportunity to score well. If you are on top of your game and can pop a 290 yard tee shot over the fairway bunkers on the right then you will find your ball perched on the front edge of the green with an eagle opportunity awaiting. Two fairway bunkers are found on each side 235 yards from the green where the holes doglegs so whether you play aggressive or conservative off the tee you’ll want to stay short or go long of the sand. Obviously there is more safety left than right, so if you can make a swing that will take the right side out of play then hammer away and make something happen here.
7th Hole at Fallen Oak Golf Club (330 Yard Par 4)
Bogey Beware:  5th Hole – 488 Yard Par 4 – Playing straight south into the prevailing wind, the lengthy 5th can play even longer than the card indicates. Two fairway bunkers sit in the driving zone on left side 275 yards from the back tee box and then a lake picks up where the bunkers left off to protect the rest of the left side all the way to the green. The fairway narrows along the water and a bunker protects the front left of the circular green to provide a difficult approach shot to contend with. With the fairway tilting slightly towards the water, it is easy to have a ball turnover towards the hazard when the ball is pinched without a fading follow through. Be smart here and take the big number out of play.

96,Fallen Oak Golf Club,non100,"Saucier, MS",Tom Fazio,2006,Fallen Oak at the Beau Rivage makes you feel like a member of a private club in Mississippi,Jason Lusk,rev096_fallen_oak_2,"SAUCIER, Miss. – Golf architect Tom Fazio is a heavyweight in the private club world. His designs pepper the Golfweek’s Best list of top private courses across the U.S., with dozens of such facilities among the top modern courses in the country.

Wade Hampton Club in North Carolina, Congaree in South Carolina, Estancia in Arizona — those and more than 50 others rank highly, and they’re all private. His courses tend to be part of clubs that excel in catering to their memberships’ every whim.

Golfweek’s Best Top 50 Casino Courses for 2023
Fazio also has excelled in building courses for another segment of golf: casinos. Fazio either designed or collaborated on seven of the top 50 casino courses in the U.S. Best of all, these highly ranked layouts are open to the public, albeit sometimes only to guests staying at the affiliated casino resort.

Fazio’s Shadow Creek in Las Vegas has topped the Golfweek’s Best rankings of casino courses in the U.S. for years. The over-the-top desert layout in North Las Vegas is a testament to what might be accomplished when money is no issue, and the layout’s $1,000-plus green fee is aligned with that. The amount of play at Shadow Creek is also limited — stay at the MGM, take a limo to the course, be treated like a star.

But there’s another way to experience the best of Fazio casino golf that shouldn’t be missed, and it’s much more attainable.

Fallen Oak
No. 18 at Fallen Oak in Mississippi (Jason Lusk/Golfweek)

Fallen Oak near Biloxi, Mississippi, is a much more natural layout than Shadow Creek. And the course – operated in conjunction with MGM’s Beau Rivage Resort & Casino, a AAA Four Diamond award winner — might offer the best opportunity for public golfers to experience a top Fazio layout and all the first-rate trappings that generally come with it. Fallen Oak is No. 2 on the Golfweek’s Best list of top casino courses in the U.S.

From the gated entrance and long drive past live oaks and ponds to the stately clubhouse, all the way to the personalized lockers and frozen watermelon served at the turn on a hot day, Fallen Oak makes a public-access player feel like a member of an elite club. The service is second to none in the public-access golf world.

Director of golf Mark Powell makes sure of it.

“We want it to feel special, that, ‘Hey, I’m at a great golf course,’ ” said the longtime PGA of America pro who took the helm at Fallen Oak in 2021. “We want to be there every step of the way. We want everyone on staff to know your name.”

Fallen Oak Mississippi
No. 17 at Fallen Oak in Mississippi (Jason Lusk/Golfweek)

Guests of the Beau Rivage gain access to all this on a course that’s never crowded, hosting just 14,000 or so rounds a year. Counting the several weeks a year Fallen Oak is closed for maintenance – a luxury most public-access layouts can’t afford — it works out to about 40 players a day.

Go ahead, stretch out. Enjoy the quiet. It’s rare these days.

Fazio’s layout at Fallen Oak opened in 2006, and for a decade it hosted the PGA Tour Champions event in Mississippi. And unlike the heavily manufactured Shadow Creek, Fallen Oak sits on a tremendous Southern site that seems entirely natural for golf. Aside from its high ranking among casino courses, Fallen Oak is the top-rated public-access course in Mississippi. The green fee tops out at $275 — you could play four rounds at Fallen Oak for not much more than one round at Shadow Creek — and the resort runs stay-and-play specials.

Fallen Oak also is No. 24 on Golfweek’s Best list of all resort courses in the United States, and it comes in at No. 74 on Golfweek’s Best list of top modern courses built since 1960 in the U.S.

Fallen Oak’s rolling terrain is dotted with wetlands and specimen trees, some of which were relocated during construction. Conditioning is top notch, equal to elite private clubs even in the heat of a Mississippi summer. The greens have plenty of motion without ever crossing a line into too-difficult territory.

Best of all: the bunkering.

Many resort courses slash bunkers across their countrysides, threatening players of all levels and distance. Fallen Oak, by contrast, offers restrained bunkering, one well-placed trap often serving the job. Fallen Oak underwent a major bunker renovation in 2014 in which numerous traps were removed, and the remaining bunkers were given a face-lift again in 2022.

Fallen Oak Mississippi
No. 3 at Fallen Oak in Mississippi (Jason Lusk/Golfweek)

Many holes feature only one fairway bunker. No. 2 is a long par 4, and there is just one fairway bunker on the left side – the hole doesn’t need any more protection. It’s similar at Nos. 4 and 9 on the front side. No. 11 has no fairway traps, and the rest of the back nine is similarly restrained. The ground moves enough through the wide corridors to provide challenge without every stray shot splashing into sand.

Same goes around most of the greens. Play a round at Fallen Oak and you’ll face more chips and pitches than bunker splash-outs. The entire layout, since the bunker renovations, shows a lovely level of understatement married to an extremely comfortable Gulf Coast motif. The terrain and the trees, the ponds and the greens are free to shine without too much sand in your face. You can always head to the beach if you want more sand.

“The first re-do they did, I tell ya, I was really impressed,” said Powell, who was working at another Mississippi club at the time. “I had played here before, back in the early days, and that was always kind of a knock on the course, too many bunkers. After the re-do, when I saw the course, I said this is even better. It’s awesome.”

The par-72 layout can be stretched beyond 7,500 yards, but from the proper tees it’s a treat of attempted shotmaking into smooth putting surfaces. Good shots are rewarded, and the roll-offs around several greens require strategic approaches to the proper sides of the hole. There’s not a thoughtless approach on the 510-acre property, and at the same time there’s not one that’s unattainable.

It’s a perfect attribute to the Beau Rivage, which is packed with highly rated dining and other curated experiences besides the golf. A word of advice: Plan your visit during baseball season, and take in a Biloxi Shuckers minor-league game at MGM Park across the street from the casino resort. It’s an intimate ballpark that provides a great break from the gaming tables.

The golf club is open to any guests of the Beau Rivage, with Powell and his staff hosting frequent special events for VIPs of the casino. Put in enough time at the tables and you might be invited to play in a sponsored tournament for casino credit that can run into the thousands of dollars. The club also has a small membership of invited casino regulars, and Powell hosts all kinds of interesting events for them, too.

“We just want to make it fun for everybody,” Powell said. “We’ve got member tournaments, a great club championship, all kinds of games during the week.

“We’re constantly looking to do every little thing we can to improve the guest experience. Sometimes a little thing goes a long way.”

Sound like a public-access private club? That’s the idea, executed perfectly.

The Preserve Mississippi

Fallen Oak isn’t the only Mississippi course to earn a spot in the Golfweek’s Best ranking of U.S. casino courses. There are four others: The Preserve, the Oaks and Azaleas courses at Dancing Rabbit, and Shell Landing. (See the full list starting on page 40.)

The Preserve Golf Club – the highest-ranked of those four – in Vancleave near Biloxi features a design by Jerry Pate that opened in 2006, the same year as Fallen Oak. Routed past several large ponds among stately oaks, the well-manicured layout features fairly wide fairways and tricky green complexes. There’s generally room to bail out away from numerous water hazards, and the layout’s shaping is interesting without ever being overbearing. The 245-acre property is surrounded by a nature preserve, further enhancing its great sense of remoteness.

The best stretch at the par-71 Preserve is probably Nos. 11 and 12, both short par 4s that make a player think. It might be wise to leave the driver in the bag to set up the best angles into each green, but bold players can attack. Both holes offer a great chance at birdie and a real possibility for a score much higher – great fun. 

The peak green fee in spring is listed as $220, but lower costs are available in the shoulder seasons and summer. Stay-and-play packages are available in conjunction with the Palace Casino Resort, a AAA Four Diamond award winner."

Starter: From a golf perspective, big things have been happening in the Missouri Ozarks and the opening of Ozarks National in early November is the most recent. Payne’s Valley, a Tiger Woods design, is scheduled to open in fall 2019 right next door. Bill Coore and Ben Crenshaw have teamed to become one of the most respected architectural teams in the world and any of their creations merits attention. Ozarks National is open for preview play through Dec. 15 and then will close for the winter months.

Play because ...: Though no official announcement has been made, Ozarks National is expected to be one of the courses used in the PGA Tour Champions' Legends of Golf event in April, replacing neighbor Buffalo Ridge Springs. Grand opening festivities at Ozarks National are planned to coincide with the Legends of Golf. Without question, though, this course will be one of the most talked about in 2019.

Takeaway: The course is in a gorgeous setting with beautiful vistas and not much water. It has an unusually diverse collection of holes, and they’ll keep a golfer's attention throughout. Though the course is ready for play, many more things are still to be done. A spacious clubhouse is expected to be ready sometime next spring and a 15-acre practice range, a putting course and two additional practice greens will also be added eventually.

Rarely will a par-3 be the No. 2 handicap hole on any course, but this one merits that distinction. This hole will take its place among the best long par-3s in the country. The small, uphill green is protected by a ravine on the left and trees on the right. There’s very little room for error here.

This is a hole to behold, a true short par 4 that’s reachable for all levels of players if they use the proper tee. There are tougher par-4 holes on the layout, but this one perfectly fits what this course is all about — a fun, but still meaningful, challenge that you’ll remember once the round is over.

The course’s No. 1 handicap hole comes right after somewhat of a breather at the par-3 eighth. That dramatic transition may accentuate the difficulty of the longer hole. Still, this winding hole is the longest on the course — definitely a three-shotter."

Ozarks National at Big Cedar Lodge in Branson, Missouri is the most challenging course at the resort.  Demands your full attention on every shot.  Ruggedly beautiful landscape.

Introduction
I was talking to a friend in advance of my recent trip to Big Cedar Lodge, and we got to the topic of golf courses.  “I’ve heard the Coore & Crenshaw course is really good,” he said.  “Yes,” I replied, “and also water is wet and the sky is blue.”

Such is life for the most heralded design team in golf.  Ben Crenshaw and Bill Coore get their choice of the best projects, but they must also deal with sky high expectations.  They can’t make a course that’s merely good, it must be great, and a great course is what they created at Ozarks National.

Check out Big Cedar’s original course, Buffalo Ridge, HERE

Practice Facilities
Ozarks National has the full complement of practice facilities that you’ll need before a challenging round.  There’s a large driving range and a putting green that mirrors those on the course.  My favorite element is the massive short game area, shown above.  There are multiple greens, numerous bunkers, and acres of fairway.  This gives you the opportunity to practice all the testing short game shots you’ll need to save pars at Ozarks National.  I love that the greens are all situated above or below the surrounds, just like on the course.

Customer Service & Amenities
Ozarks National has a full clubhouse of its own stocked with soft goods bearing the ringed pheasant logo.  As with all Big Cedar Lodge properties, the customer service is excellent.

There is a Turn Station at the 10th hole which offers your standard assortment of mid-round snacks.  What’s unusual, in a good way, is that everything (except alcohol) is complimentary.

Finally, there are forecaddies available at Ozarks National.  This is the one course at Big Cedar Lodge where I think having a caddie will impact your round because the design of this course is so nuanced.  Knowing where to aim your tee shots and what hazards to avoid will save you strokes and boost your enjoyment.  



Beauty & Scenery
Ozarks National has a rugged beauty that stands in sharp contrast to what you’ll find throughout most of Big Cedar Lodge.  Where Payne’s Valley [review HERE] is beautiful in a very manicured way, Ozarks National has a more natural aesthetic.

Another thing that sets Ozarks National apart from the other courses at Big Cedar Lodge is that it’s played entirely atop a set of ridges.  Buffalo Ridge and Payne’s Valley play up and down elevation, but Ozarks National remains high throughout the round.  This affects the play, which I’ll discuss later, and it also provides long, gorgeous views of the Ozarks on every hole.

Tee Shots
A quick peek at the scorecard could lead you to underestimate Ozarks National’s length.  Across four sets of tees plus a combo set, it ranges from 5,025 yards to 7,036 yards.  But before you strut to the tips, take a look at the pair of meaty par 3s – 216 and 254 yards – and recognize that this course plays to a par of 71.  The blue tees at 6,510 are plenty of golf for all but the best players.

Similarly, at a glance the fairways at Ozarks National seem pretty generous.  A closer look reveals that the fairways pinch and swell at strategic distances.  If you’re content to lay back, you often have more margin for error.  If you choose to push your drive to the limits, the course will demand superior accuracy.  Ozarks National never takes driver out of your hands, but it does occasionally suggest alternatives.

Adding to the demands of the tee shot is the fact that these fairways will run out a lot.  Because Ozarks National is built on ridges, it drains the fastest and is exposed to the most wind.  This means that it plays the firmest and fastest of any Big Cedar Lodge course.  You can land your tee shot in the fairway then watch helplessly as it runs into trouble.  This is a major reason why forecaddies, or hard-earned local knowledge, are key to scoring well.

Approaches
There are only two cuts at Ozarks National: fairway and the native Buffalo Grass.  The Buffalo Grass is thin and wiry, but it is allowed to be quite tall in spots.  If your drive strays from the fairway, you’re rolling the dice.  You may get a benign lie, you may find your ball tangled in long strands of Buffalo Grass, or you might lose it altogether.  There are certainly situations where you’d rather be in a fairway bunker than tangled in the native grass.  The best solution is to hit all thirteen fairways.



The large, gentle movements of the fairways combined with the firm, fast conditions mean that you won’t have to deal with many difficult stances.  Tee shots tend to collect in low, flat areas, so accurate drives are rewarded.  On the other hand, you can find some very athletically challenging positions in the Buffalo Grass.

Thanks to the conditions, you do have the ability to run the ball into the green, if you choose.  However, because many of the greens are elevated, this is not necessarily the easier route.  The greens at Ozarks National are above average in size, so landing a shot on them isn’t too difficult if you’re playing from the short grass.  That said, the firm conditions I’ve mentioned so many times continue through the greens, so you’ll need to come in high with spin or land short of your target.

Greens & Surrounds
Outside of the Buffalo Grass, there is no rough at Ozarks National.  This means that the surrounds are a short game playground where anything goes.  The grass here is a little fluffier than at Payne’s Valley, but it’s cut tight to allow for putting from anywhere, running chips, or flop shots, if you have the nerve.

The primary challenge in the short game is that most of the greens are elevated.  This means that your bunker shots and pitches will need to rise quickly then check.  The ground game is an option, but only if you leave your ball in the correct locations.  Even then, correctly judging pace is no easy task.

Once you get your ball onto the putting surface, the vast majority of your work is done.  The greens at Ozarks National are pretty tame, favoring gentle movements to sharp undulations, tiers, or ridges.  These greens will keep every match tense to the last.  Even if you miss a GIR, any pitch onto the green is likely to have a reasonable chance of saving par.

Overall Design
From the aesthetics to the strategy, Ozarks National is the mirror image of Payne’s Valley.  Where Tiger’s course packs the challenge into the greens, Ozarks National demands more of your ball striking.  I would also say that there’s more to take in from a design and strategy standpoint at Ozarks National.  I heard this course referred to as “PhD-level golf,” which is a term I’ll certainly be appropriating for future use.

It’s also worth noting that Ozarks National is the most walkable full length course at Big Cedar Lodge.  The green to tee distances are minimal, and there aren’t many dramatic elevation changes.  Walking the course gives you a great chance to appreciate the movement of the land and the subtle design elements.



Favorite Holes
#5 – Par 4 – 352 Yards

At 352 yards from the tips, this might not seem like a drivable par 4, but it plays downhill and will definitely tempt you to go for it.  The trees to the left of the fairway will make the conservative player reach for a mid-iron.  No matter how you play it, you’ll want to try it again.

#17 – Par 3 – 144 Yards

The scorecard would lead you to believe that this short par 3 is meant to ease you into the end of the round.  While it isn’t long, there’s nothing easy about it.  You have very little margin for error left or right, and the bunker shots that will follow an errant approach are extremely challenging.

Conclusion
Coore & Crenshaw have designed some of the best golf courses in the world, and Ozarks National deserves to be considered among them.  This is a beautiful, engaging course that you’ll want to play again as soon as you walk off the 18th.  To me, that’s the surest sign of a great course."

WILDERNESS CLUB HOLE BY HOLE
In this section, I will describe each hole at The Wilderness Club. I will give you my opinion on how you should play the hole and my thoughts on each hole. Remember, these are only my opinions based upon my background and experience in the golf world. Feel free to comment below with your own opinions! If you would like to know more about my background, read this.


Scorecard
#1 PAR 4

#1 Tee
The opening hole at The Wilderness Club is a slight dogleg to the left. This hole is a good preview of what is to come, driving over tall grassy areas and many well placed bunkers to catch any errant shots. A good drive on this hole will be down the left side of the fairway. There is a large bunker complex on the right side of the green so an approach from the left side will take these bunkers out of play. There is a large bunker behind the green on the left as well.

Wilderness Club #1 Green
#1 Green
#2 PAR 4

#2 Tee
Number 2 at Wilderness will require length and accuracy off of the tee. Another dogleg left, you will need to decide how much bunker you want to carry off of the tee. If you aim for the left side of the bunker on the opposite side of the fairway, you will be in a good position for your approach. There is a large bunker complex left of this green which can make a back left pin placement very difficult.

Wilderness Club #2 Green
#2 Green
#3 PAR 5

#3 Tee
The third hole is a Par 5 that moves right as you approach the green. There is a wide landing area for your drive, but keeping it on the left-center of the fairway will give you a better view of where you want to hit your second shot.


#3 Landing Area
There is a large bunker down the right side and in front of this green, so staying on the left side again on your second shot is best. There are another 2 bunkers along the front left of this green. The green is very long from front to back so choose your approach iron carefully to avoid a monster putt.

Wilderness Club #3 Green
#3 Green
#4 PAR 4

#4 Tee
Another accurate drive is needed on this Par 4. This dogleg left is protected by a bunker on the left corner. Anything hit too far right will drop down into a low area and trees. A perfect drive is just to the right of the fairway bunker.

Wilderness Club #4 Green
#4 Green
As you approach this green, be careful of the pin placement. The green has a lower tier on the back right.


#4 Green Tier
#5 PAR 3

#5 Tee
The first Par 3 at The Wilderness Club is #5. This hole is all about choosing the right club to carry the pond and the bunker in front of the green. There is room to the right if you need to bail out.

#6 PAR 4

#6 Tee
Similar to the 2nd hole tee shot, this hole will make you decide how much of the waste bunker you want to carry. There is room to the right, but if you want a shorter approach to this green, you need to hit a long drive over the bunker. If you are on the right side of the fairway, your approach shot will be straight into this green that is protected on the right and left by more bunkers.

Wilderness Club #6 Green
#6 Green
#7 PAR 3

#7 Tee
This longer Par 3 will test your nerve with a back right pin placement. It is all carry over bunkers to get to the back of this green. There is room to bail on the left. Short and right is big trouble!

#8 PAR 5

#8 Tee
Another intimidating looking tee shot, aim for the left edge of the first fairway bunker. The fairway opens up for your 2nd shot and you should try to keep it down the left side for the best approach.


#8 Landing Area
On the right side of this green, there is a large bunker complex. There are also bunkers on the left. This green has 2 tiers, front and back so choose the proper iron for your approach.

Wilderness Club #8 Green
#8 Green
#9 PAR 4

#9 Tee
The ninth hole is rated as the toughest on the course. If you do not hit a good drive here, you will have a very tough time getting a par. A good drive will be down the left-center of the fairway. The hole drops off past the landing area and there is tall grass on the hillside between the fairway and the green. There is a large bunker complex on the left side of this green and more bunkers behind. This is one of the best looking approach shots you will have in Montana!

Wilderness Club #9 Green
#9 Green
#10 PAR 4

#10 Tee
The back nine starts out with a short Par 4. A driver will be too much club for most people here. The best drive will be a long iron just to the left of the big tree in the fairway. There is a pond on the left side and in front of the green. The green is long and narrow and a back-left pin placement will be the most challenging approach.

Wilderness Club #10 Green
#10 Green
#11 PAR 4

#11 Tee
A drive down the left side of this fairway will put you in a good position for your approach into this dogleg right Par 4. Fairway bunkers and trees cause problems on the right. There is a large bunker complex on the front left of this green. There is some room on the right of this green.

Wilderness Club #11 Green
#11 Green
#12 PAR 5

#12 Tee
This Par 5 does not look like much from the tee. Hit your drive down the left side of the fairway and then grab your camera. From the landing area, you will be looking at one of the best golf green settings in the country.


#12 Landing Area
The second shot should be hit down the right side of the fairway in order to take the pond out of play. The green has sand along the left side and a couple of bunkers behind.

Wilderness Club #12 Green
#12 Green
#13 PAR 3

#13 Tee
Ranked as the easiest hole at Wilderness, this Par 3 requires an uphill shot to a large green. There is a bunker complex front right and plenty of room on the left side.

#14 PAR 4

#14 Tee
This long, dogleg right Par 4, requires a long drive down the left side. There are trees and tall grass on the right side. From the left side of the fairway, you will have a straight shot into this green. There are bunkers on the right side of the green.

Wilderness Club #14 Green
#14 Green
#15 PAR 4

#15 Tee
Another longer Par 4, try to keep your drive down the left side of the fairway. There is a large bunker that runs all the way down the right side of this green. The green is long from front to back so choose your approach iron carefully.

Wilderness Club #15 Green
#15 Green
#16 PAR 4

#16 Tee
This hole is ranked as the 2nd hardest on the course. I would argue that it is the hardest! Unless you can hit a big draw off of the tee, you will be left with a long shot into this green that is surrounded by trouble. There is a pond on the left, long grass and bunkers surround this green. It takes a perfect shot to hit this green in regulation.

Wilderness Club #16 Green
#16 Green
#17 PAR 3

This Par 3 looks pretty straight forward until you reach the green. There is a lower-tier that runs along the right side of the green. As you can see, missing left is big trouble.

#18 PAR 5

#18 Tee
A great finishing hole, this Par 5 requires a carry over natural area off of the tee. The hole bends left around a lake that runs the entire length of the hole.

#18 Landing Area
If you keep your first 2 shots down the right center of the fairway, you will have the best approach into this green. There is a large bunker on the left side of the green and everything, including the green surface, slopes towards the lake.

WILDERNESS CLUB CONDITIONS & REVIEW
The Wilderness Club has been ranked by several publications as one of the best courses in Montana. I would have to agree. The course is in great condition and the greens were rolling at a 10 on the Stimpmeter. This is a championship-caliber course and would prove to be very difficult for a beginner. There are many tee shots where a long carry over natural areas or waste bunkers is required. Every hole is heavily bunkered and the greens are fast and undulated. This course is difficult for even the best players. It is one of the most beautiful courses that I have played so far, so enjoy the surroundings if your game is letting you down!

Pro Shop
The Pro Shop at The Wilderness Club is not very large and can get crowded when people are checking in. They have men’s and women’s golf attire, and golf accessories for sale. They also sell yardage books which will help any first-time players. Lessons are available from a PGA Teaching Professional.
"
100,Wilderness Club,non100,"Eureka, MT",Nick Faldo,2009,"Wilderness Club (Eureka, Montana)",Bill Satterfield,rev100_wilderness_club_2,"The Takeaway:  The Wilderness Club is one of Montana's elite tracks and well worth the drive to get there; and you can plan on it being out of your way to get there. The Nick Faldo design offers strategy and eye candy with fescue lining the fairways, rugged edged bunkers throughout the routing, and impressive elevation changes framed by mountain backdrops. Whether you are across the border in Canada or visiting Glacier National Park, The Wilderness Club is a no-brainer to stop in and play. Or even if you are a bit crazier like me, swinging up there a few hours out of the way on the way to Coeur d'Alene left me with a smile all the way to Idaho's panhandle.  Grade B+
What to Expect:  Located just a couple of miles from the Canadian border, The Wilderness Club is appropriately named due to the remote location. Nick Faldo was commissioned to offer his expertise as the course designer at this property that started as a private club but was later opened to the public to enjoy. The surrounding mountains provide a stunning backdrop for many shots you’ll have throughout the day while the bunkers and water hazards offer eye candy within the bounds of the course. The course starts with a couple of warmup holes and then is really amped up through the middle of the round before dialing back a bit in preparation for the stunning finishing holes. The conditioning of the bluegrass fairways and bentgrass greens is excellent and the setting reminds me of something you would find outside of Coeur d’Alene, ID. Fescue lines the outside of the fairways and provides a variety of different lies and challenges. The vast majority of patrons are going to ride a cart at this course that offers some significant elevation changes at times throughout the routing. The Wilderness Club is comfortably in the discussion when considering Montana’s best courses and offers some of the best, most memorable, holes in the state.
Individual Hole Analysis
Signature Hole:  12th Hole – 557 Yard Par 5 – Dramatic and daring, the risk/reward 12th is an exhilarating design that embodies the best of what The Wilderness Club has to offer. From the tee little club is offered of what to expect, but after hitting your tee shot up the fairway players are blessed with a stunning view of the second half of the hole from the largely elevated fairway. The hole tumbles down to a lower fairway that turns to the left along a large pond to a green tucked behind the water. Other than the far right side of the green, the wide and shallow putting surface is surrounded by bunkers and calls for a draw that starts over the fairway and works its way towards the water in hopes of finding the green rather than the hazard or bunkers. Visually it pairs with the 18th hole as the most impressive eye candy on the course.
12th Hole at Wilderness Club (557 Yard Par 5)
Best Par 3:  17th Hole – 175 Yards – The picturesque 17th plays along the north shore of Grob Lake and offers a formidable challenge. Four bunkers are found around the green with one of them resting between the water and the putting surface. The green angles left towards the water which sets up a sucker pin location in the back left of the putting surface. This scenic hole is the perfect prelude to the outstanding finishing hole.
17th Hole at Wilderness Club (175 Yard Par 3)
Best Par 4:  10th Hole – 320 Yards – My favorite hole on the property! This driveable par four becomes all the more tempting to try and reach in Montana's thin air that will allow your ball to carry those extra precious yards. Players going for the green will need to carry the pond that fronts the entire putting surface if they want any chance at rolling in an eagle putt. A backstop with a pair of bunkers rests behind the green to help slow down tee balls coming in too hot which can particularly be helpful when the hole plays downwind. Players laying up the right side of the hole will need to avoid the tree in the fairway and find the generous landing zone beyond the pine which allows for a comfortable 100 yard wedge shot to the pin. A variety of options and impressive mountain scenery combine to create an awesome way to start the back nine.
10th Hole at Wilderness Club (320 Yard Par 4)
Best Par 5:  18th Hole – 593 Yards – Montana's best finishing hole in the state! This lengthy closing hole plays along the western shore of Grob Lake and is framed by fescue and trees. A large bunker on the left and two smaller bunkers on the right create havoc in the landing zone for many drives before the before banks left and rolls downhill. A series of bunkers cut from right to left short of the green and act as an additional challenge to contend with if trying to reach the putting surface in two. The attractive setting and formidable challenge team up to present one of the strongest holes in the Montana.
18th Hole at Wilderness Club (593 Yard Par 5)
Birdie Time:  13th Hole – 153 Yard Par 3 – Short and sweet, this uphill par three provides one of the most simple approach shots on the course. Bunkers front the green as well as the right and rear but leave the left side wide open. The circular green is plenty large for such a short hole and offers forgiveness if you are a bit off with your pinseeking efforts. With a perfect lie and scoring club in your hand, take advantage of the 13th and roll in a bird.
13th Hole at Wilderness Club (153 Yard Par 3)
Bogey Beware:  9th Hole – 503 Yard Par 4 – When I think of The Wilderness Club, this hole is often the first one that comes to mind. From the tee the hole looks fairly unsuspecting, but if you manage to bust a big drive up the fairway you'll be presented with a long approach that plays 1-2 clubs less downhill to a green peppered with bunkers on the right side between the putting surface and the water. With a patch of waste area cutting through the fairway 25 yards short of the green, plays will need to carry their approaching shot aerially most of the way home to stay out of trouble. While not as impressive or daring as the approach shot to Pebble Beach's 8th green, that same visual is what I thought of while taking aim at the flag.
9th Hole at Wilderness Club (503 Yard Par 4)"
101,ArborLinks,non100,"Nebraska City, NE",Arnold Palmer,2002,"ArborLinks (Nebraska City, Nebraska)",Bill Satterfield,rev101_arborlinks_1,"The Takeaway:  Located just over 30 minutes from Omaha, ArborLinks enjoys a rural setting with a farming theme. While not being able to see the landing areas when playing from the tips gets old throughout the round, there are some proper holes to enjoy including the closer. Ultimately though, ArborLinks teeters on being a Top 10 course in Nebraska.  Grade B
What to Expect:  Part of the Dormie Network, ArborLinks outside of Omaha features a farming theme that blends in with the surrounding environment that is decidedly agricultural. The private club sends a forecaddie out with each group and gives the option for players to either ride in a cart or walk the relatively tame terrain the course is laid out on. With the fescue type grass framing the exterior of the fairways, the course attempts to have a links look, but it doesn’t necessarily play like one given the grass type and turf base the course features. There is a solid variety of hole shapes and lengths to enjoy with the par fives standing out most, and interestingly the par threes don’t play very long which is unusual considering the course tips out over 7000 yards. The property is maintained in good shape with the greens running faster than most courses and puts a premium on the short game to be successful. While many players may not have frame of reference for Royal Isabella golf course in Puerto Rico, I was having flashbacks to the coastal course while playing ArborLinks; not because of the setting, but due to the views from the back tee. From the tips there are very few fairways where you can see the landing zone due to the overgrowth of foliage between the tee and the short grass which gets a bit tiresome and unnecessary. All in all, ArborLinks is a solid track. While it battles to lay claim to a spot in Nebraska’s Top 10 best courses, it proves to provide an enjoyable way to spend half a day.

Individual Hole Analysis
Signature Hole:  18th Hole – 426 Yard Par 4 – The home hole at ArborLinks pays homage to the course's theme by finishing at a green next to a silo inspired structure that the carts drive through. The tee shot should play over the fairway bunkers on the left in order to find the center of the short grass since the terrain kicks balls right towards South Table Creek. The approach shot plays over a penalty area to a heavily bunkered green that calls for a fade to best avoid the trouble. It is ArborLinks most picturesque hole and one of its most difficult to walk away with a par on.
18th Hole at ArborLinks (426 Yard Par 4)
Best Par 3:  11th Hole – 139 Yards – A crafty little one-shotter, the 11th plays over North Table Creek to a unique hourglass shaped green with steep falloffs each direction except in the back where bunkers reside. With tight lies around the green and a sloping surface on the green, missing the putting surface with your tee shot will make saving par a stout task to accomplish. I love par threes that feature creativity rather than brute length, and the 11th at ArborLinks delivers with flying colors here.
11th Hole at ArborLinks (139 Yard Par 3)
Best Par 4:  12th Hole – 425 Yards – The dominant feature on the 12th is the large waste bunker flanking the right side of the fairway which should encourage players to take their tee shot up the left side. The fairway doglegs sharply around the bunker and players that think they have the juice to carry the sand to shorten up the hole better be able to fly it over 300 yards. The further up the left side you keep your tee ball the better the angle you'll have attacking the green that features a bunker protecting the front right corner. The ideal approach is a fade that starts at the left edge, and if it doesn't fade, your best chance of saving par is from the front left.
12th Hole at ArborLinks (425 Yard Par 4)
Best Par 5:  4th Hole – 550 Yards – From the back tees the ideal line is just left of the third fairway bunker on the right, but you better hit your line because tee balls that sail too far left will find themselves in the lake that hugs that side of the fairway. If you are going for the green in two you need to start your ball up the right side where a small opening is afforded to chase a ball through, but if you are laying up then staying on the left side will help you avoid the final fairway bunker and give you an angle with the most amount of width on the green to play with.
4th Hole at ArborLinks (550 Yard Par 5)
Birdie Time:  2nd Hole – 347 Yard Par 4 – A fun hole presents itself early at ArborLinks with this short par four. The conventional play calls for a tee shot that stays short of the large bunker on the far side of the fairway. From the tips, 240 yards will put you in prime shape to attack the green that is on the opposite side of North Table Creek with a chute of trees requiring players to hit an accurate approach shot. The false front is penalizing to players that aren't aggressive enough with their distance control. The alternative play is to bomb a drive over the trees that run the entire left side and try to reach the green. From the back tee box the tree line is probably too close and too tall to go for the green, but from any of the other tee boxes the green light is on.
2nd Hole at ArborLinks (347 Yard Par 4)
Bogey Beware:  9th Hole – 457 Yard Par 4 – As is the common theme at ArborLinks, the view of the fairway is mostly obscured due to the fescue grass growing taller than visuals afford of the fairway from the back tee. What you can see is the fairway bunker on the left, so aim just right of it to find the best place in the short grass. The approach shot is brutal with a large bunker and water consuming the area left of the green and another bunker on the right, but it is the skinny green that stretches out three times longer than it is wide that is difficult to hit in regulation. Keeping your ball right is critical to avoid a big number and protect your score on the front.

102,ArborLinks,non100,"Nebraska City, NE",Arnold Palmer,2002,ArborLinks Review and Highlights,OffTheDeckGolf.com,rev102_arborlinks_2,"RUNDOWN: ArborLinks was the first course acquired by the newly formed Dormie Network. The Dormie Network is comprised of high end facilities that cater to a national and business style membership. Currently The Dormie Network has 6 clubs and each member is truly a member at all of them. Their goal is to provide a high end experience to all their members and guests, no matter where they visit. They go above and beyond to make sure you feel welcome at any of the clubs. The let no small detail go unnoticed so they can ensure that you have a fantastic experience wherever you may be teeing it up.
Our experience was nothing short of amazing here. We attended the grand opening of their brand new clubhouse and it didn't disappoint. What a wonderful space for their members and guests to enjoy when they aren't out on the course. They have on property cottages for stay that consist of two to four bedrooms. You really do not have to leave this place once you arrive, we definitely didn't. With the golf, food and accommodations being so fantastic, we found our rental car stayed exactly where we parked it upon arrival. 
The course, as we will show you, is no slouch when it comes to play. It is set up as a course that demands accuracy off the tee. The fairways can be somewhat narrow at times and the rough can be outright nasty! Keep it in the short grass so your wrists don't hurt as bad as your scores can. 
This Arnold Palmer design is very well thought out and provides the every player, no matter skill level, the chance to enjoy themselves. Blind shots off the tee will only add to the excitement of what sits just beyond your view. It sits northwest of Arbor Day Farms, and the course is high on conserving and furthering the development of the habitat it sits in. You will enjoy views of rolling hills and natural grasses, all while knowing the course was planned out and executed in a way to conserve this area.
Hole 2 ""National Tree Trail"" Par 4 - 347 Yards
Most people will take an iron out on this hole and layup short of the crossing stream. If that is your play, keep it right, but short of the bunkers. If you happen to pull it left then you will block yourself from seeing the green on the approach. However, if you are feeling confident in the long game, pull out the big stick and let it fly! It will require a high tee ball that can find a relatively small landing area near the the green. There is no room for error if you go for the green, so the layup will generally yield a better chance at birdie here. The green has a ridge running through the middle of it that separates the back and front of the green. Ultimately, get on in two and birdie is a definite possibility here.
Hole 3 “Plum Thicket” Par 3 - 167 Yards
Welcome to the first par 3 on the course and just an overall enjoyable hole. After a reachable par 5 on the 1st hole and a short par 4 on the second, this is a hole that can keep your momentum going. You should have a wedge or short iron in your hands that will allow for a scoring opportunity. However, don't sleep on the shot as the front bunker may come into play depending on pin position. It is a deep bunker, I experienced it first hand, and will require a solid up and down to get away without losing a shot. The green is separated by a ridge that runs through the middle of it. Get on the wrong side and you can be left with quite the putt. We loved the par three's here because we actually played them very well. Each of us walked away with a couple of birdies on this gettable par 3!
Hole #7 ""Baldcypress Bay"" Par 4 - 414 Yards
This fairly straightforward par 4 had my number over the multiple rounds we played it. I struggle with pulling my tee shot or over hooking the hell out of. As you can see, that doesn't lead to good things on this hole. The thick rough is the only thing that helped me out on a couple drives, but then I was just in the thick rough. We did have a couple rounds where the wind was ripping at our back though. We each sent a couple of bombs down the middle and ended up just short of the green. However, most of the time when hitting out of the thick rough, I ended up long or in the bunker. With approach shots like those, this hole can really bump that score up. Play the tee game well and it is a decently easy par 4 that can help your score.
Straight down aerial view of ArborLinks hole 7
Hole #11 ""Hickory Hollow"" Par 3 - 139 Yards
My favorite par 3 on the property! It probably helps that I nearly flew it in for an ace on my first go around here. I ended up about a foot from the cup with a tap in birdie. The second round was no different as Kevin placed his shot to about 2 feet and rolled in an easy birdie. That by no means makes this short hole easy, it just happened to suit our eye and play well into our yardages. We each experienced missing short and right several times. When missing this green you better hope you have practiced your chipping game since an up and down will test your skills! If the hole plays to a comfortable yardage for you then this hole can be one of your favorites, like ours. If the hole plays in-between clubs for you, get ready for a true test on a short hole.
ArborLinks hole 11 green
Hole #12 ""Planetree Place"" Par 4 - 425 Yards
This hole played as one of the tougher par 4's for us on the property. However, it was great to look at! The large waste area framed the right side and provided a decent challenge off the tee. While a tee shot into the bunker could provide a shorter approach shot, waste bunkers are never the play haha. The approach shot we faced from the bunker resulted in a large carry that included an uphill shot with a deep green-side bunker. So, it goes without saying, but get in the fairway here! The thick rough on the left will result in a layup if the the pin sits on the right side of the green. Playing from the fairway requires a well placed shot over the bunker to a green that will kick your ball to the back quickly. Par is the score that you will want here as bogey and higher can creep in quickly!
Hole #16 ""Walnut Way"" Par 5 - 574 Yards
The image above will give you a peek of the par 5 10th hole as well (on the right). You can see just how much the fairway pinches down in the driving area. We seemed to go right almost every single time there. My advice, hit it far left of where you think you should, that still may not be enough! So, to hole #16. This par 5 is a beast and will be reachable only with a wind at your back, or if you move up a couple of tee boxes. A solid drive can cut the corner slightly, but make sure you get all of your drive or you will be in some fescue that will kill any chance of a good score here. A long approach shot will prove tough with this well guarded green. We played from the bunkers numerous times as we came up short of the mark. This par 5 is long, but birdie is definitely in play on this one.
Hole #18 ""Cottonwood Creek"" Par 4 - 426 Yards
What a wonderful finishing hole! Make sure to pull out the correct club here as a drive that sails too far will run through the fairway and into the brush. Although it is not visible from the tee, you do have room to miss to the right. There is a large hill that slopes down to a flat area that will collect wayward shots. You will however be hitting an approach from the rough with trees potentially blocking your view of the green. Avoid the large fairway bunkers on the left and place a long iron or wood into the wide landing zone. Your approach here is key! The green sits diagonal from left to right and slopes away in the middle. Avoid the deep bunker on the right if you would like a chance at par here. Any shot coming out of there will quickly run away from you. Overall, this hole will play like the rest of the course, a true test of your ball striking. Keep it in the short grass and hit your spots and you can score well. However, you will run your score up if you get in the rough or the trouble spots on this hole. Enjoy the view of the brand new clubhouse that has a large area to view this fantastic finishing hole. Better yet, make sure you enjoy the view from the clubhouse after your round going over the shots you made and missed out there."
103,Royal Links Golf Club,non100,"Las Vegas, NV",Pete Dye,1998,"Royal Links Golf Club (Las Vegas, Nevada)",Bill Satterfield,rev103_royal_links_1,"The Takeaway:  A theme course like Royal Links is a perfect fit for the fantasy land of Las Vegas. In a town that features replicas of the Eiffel Tower, Statue of Liberty, and the Trevi Fountain, it is only fitting that a golf course that replicates famous holes from Europe would be built in Sin City. Unfortunately the setting and terrain of the desert isn't a great fit for these links course inspired legends which detracts from the overall experience that is trying to be accomplished. All in all, the course is a fun novelty but it is certainly no substitute for a trip across the pond.  Grade B-
What to Expect:  In Las Vegas anything can happen, including playing links golf through the desert. That's right, Pete Dye was hired to recreate some of the most famous holes from the other side of the Atlantic Ocean in an effort to give patrons a chance at playing these storied holes. While you won't have the coastal winds, you'll still have plenty of sand and the design elements that have made these holes so impressive. Golfers are given the opportunity to hit the ""Postage Stamp"" green replicated from Royal Troon, attack the long dogleg left 15th from Carnoustie, and challenge the ""Road Hole"" from St. Andrews. It's a unique experience and a chance to play a course in Las Vegas that isn't overdone with unnatural features but you are sure to discover some hidden bunkers and fescue that even the pros would struggle to get out of. While the course can't offer the setting, scenary, and history of Scotland or England, it is a chance to discover some of the great architectural features found there.
Individual Hole Analysis
Signature Hole:  10th Hole – 466 Yard Par 4 – The most famous hole on the other side of the pond is also the signature hole at Royal Links; the world renowned Road Hole. Featured as the 17th hole at St. Andrews, the Road Hole at Royal Links is the opening hole on the back nine and the most memorable on the property. Rather than a hotel to aim for over the right corner, golfers are faced with a large scoreboard that protects the ideal line over the dogleg. With the short stone wall framing the hole and the Road Hole Bunker awaiting ill fated approach shots, this replica is a joy to play.

Best Par 3:  8th Hole – 153 Yards – Inspired by one of the most famous par threes in the country, this replica of Royal Troon's Postage Stamp hole is the finest one-shotter on the course. There are two bunkers well shy of the green, one to the right and the other on the left, as well as two deep greenside bunkers, one on each side. The deep bunker on the left is an absolute bear to get out of and the rectangular bunker on the right isn't a whole lot more fun. Hit the green and there is little to fear; find the bunker and prepare for Old Man Par to kick your tail.

Players can have the easy road off the tee or on the approach, but not both. Players that elect to take the easy road on the tee will have to contend with the most treacherous bunker in golf history; the Road Hole Bunker. Pars made from this infamous bunker are few and far between and often have much more to do with luck then skill.

Best Par 5:  18th Hole – 515 Yards – Royal Links' final hole goes back to the home of golf for inspiration again at the famed St. Andrews Golf Links. The rolling fairway is split in two by a deep bunker with a high road on the right and low road on the left. A large built up bunker partially blocks the view heading to the green where four pot bunkers await short of the green as well as to the left. It is a fitting ending to an admirable course paying homage to the other side of the pond.
18th Hole at Royal Links Golf Club (515 Yard Par 5)
Birdie Time:  5th Hole – 322 Yard Par 4 – Similar to the 12th hole at St. Andrews, this short par four begs for players to take a rip at the green and chase one up for a potential eagle putt. Five hidden bunkers potentially come into play off the tee with four of the bunkers being found inside the fairway borders. The rolling fairway can kick balls towards the sand or towards the green; it is simply rub of the green. If you can manage to avoid the hazard along the way, this short par four presents an excellent opportunity to circle a birdie.
Bogey Beware:  4th Hole – 621 Yard Par 5 – Tipping out at an impressive 621 yards, this lengthy par five draws inspiration from the 8th hole at Royal Liverpool in Hoylake. With only a single bunker found on the course, short right of the green, the hole begs to let the big dog hunt off the tee. After the tee shot the fairway narrows down to a quarter of the width it is at its widest point and players can elect to play towards this small target or blow it over the hillocks encroaching in from the right side of the hole. The relatively small green is raised and slopes toward treacherously deep bunker that could prove to be the most difficult up and down on the course. With brutish length and challenging terrain, the 4th hole at Royal Links could quickly put a box on your scorecard.

From the giant Claret Jug to the Castle-like clubhouse, you get an immediate golf high that helps you to forget about the beating you took at the craps table the night before.

Royal Links Golf Club might be a short drive from the Las Vegas Strip, but we found it to be miles ahead of many of the other Vegas courses that we have played in recent Las Vegas golf trips. I admit that I am a bit skeptical of “inspired by” courses, but Royal Links has done this in a way that does not feel out of place or over the top. Each of the 18 holes is inspired by a hole from 11 different British Open Courses. From the “Road Hole” to the “Postage Stamp”, you really get an authentic feeling and connection to courses and features that I have only seen on television. This was a nice change from the typical desert style golf that you get in and around Las Vegas.

We played in the late December, so conditions in Vegas were probably closer to Scotland than we wanted. Despite the near freezing temperature, the conditions at Royal Links were top notch. Much of the course was dormant this time of year, but the green complexes were a bright emerald that contrasted nicely on the relatively flat layout. Just like the old courses, expect hard, fast greens and fairways that always seem to funnel your tee shots into deep unforgiving bunkers.


A nice golf setting at the Royal Links 18th Green in Las Vegas
The clubhouse and bar are a nice addition to the overall experience. Stymie’s Bar was a perfect replica of a traditional English Pub, right down to the fireplace and Soccer on the television.

Royal Links is definitely on my list of top courses to play in Las Vegas, and many others agree. It was recognized as the “Best Course in Las Vegas” in 2006 by the “Best of Vegas” poll. GolfWeek as named it as one of “Americas Best Courses”.

Don’t come to Royal links expecting a leisurely recovery round after a long night out. Come to Royal Links Golf Club prepared to hit quality shots and 50 yard bump and runs.

Royal Links Golf Club is one of two courses in Las Vegas owned by Walters Golf. Their other course is Bali Hai Golf Club right on the strip."
105,Black Mesa Golf Club,non100,"Espanola, NM",Baxter Spann,2003,"Black Mesa Golf Club (Espanola, New Mexico)",Bill Satterfield,rev105_black_mesa_1,"The Takeaway:  Black Mesa has the bones to be a really good course but is an unfortunate example of what happens when a course isn't properly maintained. With weeds growing all over in the rough, bunkers, and often in the fairways, there was a point I was questioning why I was even there. The thin turf throughout the course wasn't ideal either. There is no doubt that Black Mesa has one of the most intriguing layouts in the West and is a must-see in New Mexico, but until the conditioning is improved the course won't play as the Top 100 layout Mr. Spann intended and thus not near as enjoyable as it could be.  Grade B
What to Expect:  Black Mesa features some of the most stunning vistas and terrain an inland golf course can enjoy with a setting distant from highways and city lights. The Baxter Spann layout north of Santa Fe is carved in among high desert terrain, rocks, and arroyos which lends to hosting undulated fairways and greens, blind shots, and over 100 bunkers. The links course is void of any trees and thus subject to the crossing winds that can change the way the course plays on a daily basis. Black Mesa is highlighted with an impressive collection of par 3s, unforgettable par 5s, and engaging elevation changes that lead to a variety of enjoyable shots. The biggest letdown by far was the poor conditioning that existed during my visit; fortunately that can always change.

Individual Hole Analysis
Signature Hole:  16th Hole – 536 Yard Par 5 – The view you'll find on a lot of Black Mesa's marketing material is from the 16th tee that affords an impressive view of the 16th fairway that carves its way naturally between the stark hills framing each side. A pair of bunkers on the right side of the fairway pinch the landing zone to its tightest width, but if they are avoided then a great opportunity presents itself to reach the green in two. The fairway climbs 35 feet enroute to the highly undulated green where if you miss left your ball will quickly tumble down to the native area. You have to find the fairway off the tee for any chance of taking a birdie here, so 3 wood is a good play if your driver hasn't been reliable up to this point in the round.
16th Hole at Black Mesa Golf Club (536 Yard Par 5)
Best Par 3:  11th Hole – 172 Yards – Over 20 feet of climb awaits on the 11th that sits in a natural bowl at the base of the surrounding mesas. The putting surface is twice as deep as it is wide so you'll need accuracy more than distance control as you flight your ball back to the pin location. All of the bunkering is short of the green so you are better off to go long if you are between clubs, but beware of the back third of the putting surface that runs away from the player. This is just a solid one-shotter that requires some concentration to conquer.
11th Hole at Black Mesa Golf Club (172 Yard Par 3)
Best Par 4:  2nd Hole – 404 Yards – The 2nd hole sits naturally between a pair of ridges with an aiming bunker 300 yards straight away. The fairway tilts from right to left so be wary of going too far left and getting an unfortunate bounce towards the native area. The uphill tee shot plays to a raised green that features a sloping edge off the front left while approach shots that sail right of the putting surface have a good opportunity of bounding off the neighboring hill and onto the putting surface.
Best Par 5:  13th Hole – 591 Yards – Players descend nearly 50 feet from the back tee enroute to the green with most of the drop coming on the tee shot. With the bunkers being out of reach for most mortals, this is a time to grip it and rip it with all the length you can handle being afforded straight away. The fairway begins turning left while the fairway tilts away to the right and creates a shotmaking opportunity that avoids the cross bunker 120 yards from the green. The hourglass putting surface is more than three times longer than it is wide and provides for a variety of pin placements to contend with that can seem tough to attack with sand flanking both sides of the green. Reaching this green in two is quite the accomplishment and must be done with an approach coming in from the high left side.
13th Hole at Black Mesa Golf Club (591 Yard Par 5)
Birdie Time:  7th Hole – 356 Yard Par 4 – The short 7th is a chance to card a birdie before taking on the challenging 8th that awaits. If you are laying up you won't want to hit anything more than 210 yards which will keep you short of the bunkers and set up a wedge or low iron into the green. If you are hitting driver then take aim at the right side of the fairway bunker on the left and swing away. The downhill nature of the shot combined with the firm fairways will tumble shots to the low area shy of the green. From there, a simple pitch to the green that sits horizontal is required. Don't worry about the lack of depth to work with; you have plenty of width and a scoring club in your hand to knock it close with.
7th Hole at Black Mesa Golf Club (356 Yard Par 4)
Bogey Beware:  17th Hole – 424 Yard Par 4 – Hopefully you aren't weary by the time you reach the 17th hole, but it will require all of your concentration to avoid bogey on. This dogleg left features a partially blind landing area and a fairway that slopes left to right towards a bunker. The approach shot plays to a raised green fronted by a series of three bunkers that must be carried to find the putting surface. Players who can't fly the ball all the way on their second shot will have to settle for laying up to the right and attempting to get up and down.

106,Black Mesa Golf Club,non100,"Espanola, NM",Baxter Spann,2003,COURSE REVIEW: BLACK MESA GOLF CLUB,Mike Stubbs,rev106_black_mesa_2,"Great golf courses are hard to come by. I don’t mean that there aren’t that many— there are. The problem is that most of the truly great ones are either private or cost prohibitive. On a recent trip to Santa Fe, New Mexico, I played Black Mesa Golf Club, which is neither private nor expensive. Calling it great only scratches the surface of what this marvelous collection of 18 holes is all about. 
Although the course is carved among the sandstone ridges of the Santa Clara Pueblo, Black Mesa has more than hint of old world Irish feel to the grounds. Take any great links course and Photoshop out all the heather and green that surrounds each hole and replace it with jagged arroyos filled with soft sand and creosote bushes and you have Black Mesa. There are mounds, bumps and blind shots—just like in Ireland—which will, no doubt, drive every level of player mad. But you are quickly overcome with pleasure when you stand on each tee and admire the beauty of a course that follows the natural terrain so perfectly that you’ll wonder if dinosaurs roamed on the same Kentucky bluegrass that appears to drip off the sandstone formations. 

Memorable Holes 
On the first hole out of the gate, the course architect Baxter Spann perplexes the golfer with a blind shot over a ridge that may have been there for a million years. Rather than a heavy-handed use of bulldozers, Spann left the ancient ridge in place and starts the loop with a mental challenge. Your eyes say go left where you can see a glimmer of fairway, but the notes say hit it over the native ridge. The hole is not that tough—assuming you can overcome the fear of the unknown and blast it to the right.

The par-four seventh is a drivable hole that looks out over the vast expanse of the Santa Clara Pueblo. Options abound off the tee, but they must be played with precision as the fairway is protected by native areas both left and right as well as by a cross bunker about 180 yards from the tee. Although it is a short hole, the multi-tiered green offers tremendous protection against par. The seventh looks easy on the card, but it is very tricky.

Some holes you just love to play in your head over and over again. For me, the par- four 14th is just one of those holes. Like the devilish first, it is very deceiving off the tee. Your eyes wander left in a straight line to the green, but the play is to the right over yet another native ridge. If you hit it hard it enough, the ball will wind up just in front of the green; if you elect to take a more direct line you will be left with a poor view of the approach to the green. If you take the direct line and fail to fly it 300 yards (like I did —twice), you will find yourself in the native area or in one the many bunkers that protect the left side. The 14th is wildly fun…just aim right off the tee! 

Head pro Tom Velarde calls the demanding par-five 16th “stairway to seven.” There are many ways to make that number and more if you are not careful. It is a dramatic hole that looks as if it were a glacier of green snow permanently fixed among the sandstone formations. It is long and, when played in the left-to-right crosswind, very difficult. The tee shot from the elevated back tee demands a well struck drive to a steeply inclined fairway. Once on the green, two putts are certainly not guaranteed. The surface has huge undulations and it falls off severely to the back.  

Black Mesa may well be the premier course in entire state of New Mexico. Whether you are traveling with your buddies on a golf/gambling trip or there for a romantic weekend in Santa Fe, this course needs to be on the itinerary"

Typical of a Palmer course, Mid South is highlighted by the par fives and features one of the most memorable finishing holes in North Carolina.  Grade B-
What to Expect:  Mid South Club will always be overshadowed by many of its famous neighbors, but the course is a solid track that is deserving of consideration when in the sandhills of North Carolina. The trait that stands out most are the fast greens that roll beautifully and true; a feature that can be appreciated by all players. The greens were renovated in 2017 and planted with Champion Bermuda grass that is proving to thrive in that location. Also, like most Arnold Palmer designs, the par fives are the highlight of the routing with the closing hole on the front being of particular quality. In fact, the 9th and 18th share the same green in a tribute to golf on the other side of the pond. The front nine is characterized by great movement in the fairway and hole shapes that prevent players from seeing the green from the tee on any of the par fours and fives unless you are playing forward. You have to be accurate to handle The King's design here before embarking on the back with calmer terrain and more forgiving features. The final three holes certainly send players off in climatic fashion with a par four, three, and another four all having water coming into play. Mid South Club is a private club but offers various public tee times through booking sites and through accommodation packages.
Individual Hole Analysis
Signature Hole:  18th Hole – 435 Yard Par 4 – This is quite the finishing hole. At 435 yards most players will want the length of their driver to help them cover the yardage but the insanely tight fairway with water on the right puts a massive premium on accuracy. The further down the fairway you get the more the short grass narrows before bending around the water to a greensite that is shared by the 9th hole. In a match, this is an extremely demanding hole to keep your wits about you and finish strong.
18th Hole at Mid South Club (435 Yard Par 4)
Best Par 3:  6th Hole – 178 Yards – A picturesque one-shotter over the water, the 6th green is supported by a boulder wall in front and protected by a pair of bunkers in the back to catch shots from players who clubbed up too much in fear of carrying the water. The front left side of the green slopes back towards the water so the right half of the putting surface is the safer area to attack.
6th Hole at Mid South Club (178 Yard Par 3)
Best Par 4:  2nd Hole – 401 Yards – A classic risk/reward tee shot awaits on the 2nd as players are presented with a dogleg right hole that bends around a pond that goes all the way up to the green. A series of bunkers lies in wait on the outside of the bend ready to gobble up tee shots that steer too far clear of the water. Arnie leaves the front of the green open here which is an encouraging look, but balls that fade right will find the water while approaches going long will likely find one of the three bunkers there. It is a great hole early in the round and certainly can set the tone for how things may go for you.
2nd Hole at Mid South Club (401 Yard Par 4)
Best Par 5:  9th Hole – 542 Yards – The final hole on the front nine is an impressive finish to a memorable opening half of holes. The unassuming tee shot plays to a rippled fairway framed by trees on both sides, however upon cresting the top, players are presented with a dramatic dogleg left that traverses downhill before terminating at the pond that separates the fairway from the green. Bunkers are initially found on the outside of the dogleg before being placed on the left side prior to the water coming into play. A lone bunker sits behind the green ready to catch balls that are hit thin off the downhill lie and a wall of boulders supports the front of the putting surface. It is an exciting hole that takes some serious guts to go for in two.
9th Hole at Mid South Club (542 Yard Par 5)
Birdie Time:  16th Hole – 398 Yard Par 4 – A memorable finishing stretch at Mid South Club begins with the gettable par four. Tipped out at less than 400 yards, this two-shotter plays over water off the tee but opens up to a wide fairway over solid ground. The bold play is up the left side where the slope will help push balls back to the right, but the fairway really narrows up as you get close to the green. A tee shot to the fat part of the fairway and a wedge or low iron into the green is a great way to find a green in regulation here, but if your driver is spot on you can rip one up the left side and leave a short pitch into the green. It is a fun hole where birdie is certainly doable, but double bogies like to lurk here as well.
16th Hole at Mid South Club (398 Yard Par 4)
Bogey Beware:  5th Hole – 390 Yard Par 4 – The 5th is a unique hole that plays downhill straight towards the water with the fairway suddenly terminating at the H2O and requiring an approach shot over a channel to the green. Big hitters may consider less than driver off the tee to ensure they stay short of the hazard and leave themselves a good look at the green. The putting surface is flanked on the right by water and on the left by sand, so nothing less than a precise approach shot will be rewarded. There are a lot more ways to get in trouble here than to succeed, so use caution over valor to come off as the conqueror.

It is where rolling hills are capped by deep, coarse sands, while longleaf pine is the dominant tree species in what is considered a harsh, growing environment, these longleaf pine and Wiregrass forests may well be the most diverse North American ecosystem north of the tropics, containing rare plants and animals not found anywhere else.

Within the heart of the North Carolina Sandhills is a storied legacy of golf, unlike any other place in the country.

In 1990, when Arnold Palmer was asked to design the layout here at the Mid South Club in Southern Pines, he was given a tract of land where the rolling terrain seemed like the perfect place to build a championship-style golf course.

By 1993, the first rounds of golf were being played at Mid South Club, and not long after that, the Mid South course began hosting qualifying tournaments for the U.S. Open. U.S. Senior Open and U.S. Amateur.

One of the unique features of this golf course here at Mid South Club can be found with the water hazards that can and do come into play.

Palmer’s routing of this golf course took advantage of the natural elevation changes both off the tee and around the greens.

Mid South Club is a golf course that will test your shot making abilities.

“There's a lot of humps and bumps in the fairways here, along with a lot of uneven lies. So, it's hard to find a flat spot, and that is part of the character of the golf course.”

With its six sets of tees, you can choose just how much of a challenge you would like in your round.

From the back Gold Tees, the golf course here at Mid South Club plays to just over 7,000 yards and features of course rating of 73.8 and a slope of 144. Moving it up to the Blue Tees, the layout plays to 6,577 yards and features a course rating of 71.9 and a slope of 134. For the ladies, the Red Tees played 4,773 yards.

Mid South Club scorecard
Throughout this Palmer design at Mid South Club, you’ll find an ample amount of opportunity to post a good score, especially on the par fives.

“Most of them can be reached in two. I mean you’re going to have some trouble in front of the green nine a little long, but you get a good drive out there you can get there in two.”

Palmer also offers the golfer a good mix of par fours. Some require a driver off the tee and others do not.

While you’ll not find an inordinate amount of bunkering throughout this golf course at Mid South Club, Arnold Palmer does place them along, with waste areas in strategic locations, including the green complexes.

Mid South Club
Around the greens, you’ll find ample protection with grass mounting and bunkers.

“For the most part, you can get out without much of a problem. With the greens being fast, it does make it a little more difficult to get it close to the flag, but you can definitely get out. They’re not they’re not crazy difficult to get out.”

It is certainly worth playing if in the area, but not necessarily worth going more than an hour or two out of your way.  Grade B-
What to Expect:  The Links of North Dakota is located on the north side of the Missouri River in the northwest portion of the Flickertail State. For a course that has found itself in the Top 50 of Golfweek's Top 100 Public Courses in America list, one might expect a less humble setup. Players pull into a gravel parking lot and are greeted by a modest clubhouse, fleet of old golf carts, and dirt cart paths. For good and bad, the entire operation feels ""small town"" which can be expected considering the nearest city of any decent population is Williston which has less than 30,000 people and is 30 miles to the west. The course enjoys a nice routing with holes running a variety of different directions and fairways that are wider than normal which is particularly appealing in locations where the wind is often a factor. The pseudo links layout features fescue lining the fairways and the Missouri River creating a water backdrop which is common at true links courses, but the grass type and softer fairways don’t lend to playing like the traditional links courses found on the other side of the pond. As is the case with most links courses, you won't find any water hazards on the interior of the layout but the bunkering is strong and plentiful. The views of Lake Sakakawea, which is part of the Missouri River, highlight the visuals at the course with the front nine featuring softer movement in the property while the back nine features more aggressive and engaging terrain. Wild Horse in Nebraska is a natural comparison since it attempts to be an interior links course in a low populated area of the Midwest. I would say Wild Horse has better architecture overall but the setting at The Links of North Dakota offers superior visuals. While by all accounts the course is generally maintained in great condition, 2022 was a different story with irrigation issues that didn't allow for the normal water dispensing schedule for the tees and fairways, but the greens were well maintained. With the remote location reducing the number of potential rounds played at the course, one has to assume that there isn't a plethora of funds to dip into in order to upgrade the bunker and turf conditions. Ultimately, The Links of North Dakota doesn’t stack up with other Top 100 courses and is tough to justify going too far out of your way to go play, but hopefully the course can resurrect its former glory and become a destination again.
Individual Hole Analysis
Signature Hole:  15th Hole – 457 Yard Par 4 – No hole at the Links of North Dakota can be considered the signature offering without views of Lake Sakakawea of the Missouri River creating the backdrop, and the 15th puts it on full display. Staying right of the fairway bunker on the left will provide a generous amount of fairway to hit before the hole bends to the left with a green protected by a bunker at the front left. The infinity edge green with the water in the background delivers an inspiring view.
15th Hole at The Links of North Dakota (457 Yard Par 4)
Best Par 3:  8th Hole – 185 Yards – An attractive one-shotter with the Lake Sakakawea of the Missouri River in the distance, the 8th plays downhill and downwind. A trio of bunkers lace across the front of the green which features a bowl in the front center portion of the putting surface and creates the most interesting hole location.
8th Hole at The Links of North Dakota (185 Yard Par 3)
Best Par 4:  12th Hole – 473 Yards – The back nine is what captures player's hearts at the Links of North Dakota and this hole is the first reason why. Lake Sakakawea dominates the backdrop of this two-shotter that plays downhill and downwind with a pair of fairway bunkers creating the uprights to send your tee ball through. The approach shot plays into a green with a false front defending a putting surface that crests and slopes back. The trio of bunkers on the left play well below the putting surface and makes par saves extra difficult when short sided. It is a beautiful hole that will punish players that lose focus.
12th Hole at The Links of North Dakota (473 Yard Par 4)
Best Par 5:  18th Hole – 572 Yards – Players get one more chance to play downwind which is just what you may need in order to get home in two. The hole plays mostly straight away for a majority of the trip to the green but takes a late turn right 70 yards from the putting surface. In the final 120 yards there are five bunkers that come into play; two contending with layups and three around the green. Two well struck shots should open the door to finish with a birdie.
18th Hole at The Links of North Dakota (572 Yard Par 5)
Birdie Time:  9th Hole – 346 Yard Par 4 – The closing hole on the front nine gives players a chance to pick up a birdie to build momentum heading into the back nine. The tee shot plays 35 feet downhill and follows a fairway that bends left towards the green. A tee shot that carries the bunker on the left is a perfect line towards the green and will leave a flip wedge second shot, or for long hitters, the potential for an eagle putt.
9th Hole at The Links of North Dakota (346 Yard Par 4)
Bogey Beware:  6th Hole – 465 Yard Par 4 – Not only is the 6th the longest par four on the front nine, it plays dead into the prevailing wind which makes it much harder than the scorecard would indicate. The trio of bunkers on the right side of the fairway should be carried without much trouble and find the widest part of the fairway, but the fairway tightens from that point forward. The approach shot plays 15 feet uphill to a green with a narrow opening and a trio of bunkers on the left side. This is a tough green in regulation, and when the wind is up, bogey is a good score.

It’s been more than 10 years since the movie “Field of Dreams” imposed that mantra on the national consciousness. Remember the premise? Kevin Costner starred as an Iowa farmer who heard a voice in his head telling him to carve a baseball diamond out of his cornfield. Against all odds, thousands of people, including ghosts of superstars past, made the pilgrimage. They all came.

The golf world is actually home to dozens of examples of this kind of inspired folly. With sufficient funding and advances in irrigation, almost anything has been possible in recent years. However, no course in the United States is so remote and so great at the same time as The Links of North Dakota. It is located near nothing.

The mailing address on the scorecard is Ray, a veritable village of 603. The closest town is Williston, 28 miles away, though North Dakotans would label it a city by virtue of its 13,000 inhabitants. Without question, the closest “major” city—a three-hour drive away—is Regina, the capital of Saskatchewan, Canada, at 180,000 strong. We’re talking seriously remote—which is exactly why you should see it.

If you build it, they will come. Indeed they did. Thanks to favorable initial reviews, curious golfers from 46 states visited The Links of North Dakota within six months of the course’s opening on July 11, 1995. In 1998, the course achieved its break-even number (financially) of 10,000 rounds per year. In 1999, the course’s personable and persuasive general manager, Patty Downing, boosted the outings total from four to 15, raising rounds played to 12,000. Still, we’re hardly talking Bethpage State Park or Torrey Pines-like numbers. Which is exactly why you should go play it.


What you have is an American links that actually looks and plays in many respects like a Scottish or Irish links. It’s treeless, wind-blown and fast-running. It’s completely affordable (though high-priced for the region), with a peak green fee of around $40. It’s easily walked, and many people do. And thanks to a lack of crushing crowds, there’s no problem fitting in 36 holes a day in late spring, summer and early fall. In fact, due to its peculiar location at the far westernmost area of the Central time zone, there’s practically an extra hour of daylight all summer, so serious golf fanatics could very well squeeze in 54. (Maybe take a cart for that third round.)

It still seems wildly improbable. The Links of North Dakota occupies one of America’s bleakest landscapes, a series of barren buttes and valleys molded and twisted by ancient waterways and by eons of harsh, arid, arctic winter winds. No leafy trees, no colorfully blooming flowers, no gurgling streams grace this property.

What does grace the property are 18 superb holes draped over land ideally suited for golf: rolling and pitching and heaving and tumbling without ever calling for long hikes or heart-pounding climbs to reach greens or tees. The question remains, however: Who would build such a field of dreams and why? Another mystery is how Bronxville, N.Y., architect Stephen Kay, who does the vast majority of his work in his home state and in neighboring New Jersey, came to design the course. Once Kay explained it for the record, it all made sense, even if you hadn’t seen the movie “Fargo.”

“I teach classes in golf course construction and design at [New Jersey’s] Rutgers University,” he says. “It’s a two-year program and at the end of the first year, back in 1993 or so, a quiet student named Stan Weeks approached me and asked if I’d be interested in designing a golf course in the Midwest. I had recently married and had a new baby and I didn’t think I was interested.


“I asked Stan where in the Midwest he had in mind and he replied, ‘Western North Dakota.’ Stan was superintendent at one of the region’s only golf courses, a nine-hole country club in Williston, and felt the area could really benefit from a first-rate 18-hole course.

“Well, I didn’t think there was any way the project was for me, except for one thing: I know a shaper named Marvin Schlauch, who happened to be possibly the best shaper I had ever worked with. Wouldn’t you know, I remembered that Marvin was born and bred in North Dakota. I told Stan and his group to take some aerial photographs of the three potential sites they had. I agreed that if we could get Marvin Schlauch to shape the course and we could all agree on a site, we’d have a deal.”

Of the three sites considered, two were close to Williston, which took care of the access factor, but the terrain was dead level and featureless. The piece of ground that appealed to all was a 30-minute drive from Williston, but was a wonderful, rolling, perfectly natural patch of golfing ground that overlooked the 200-mile-long, man-made Lake Sakakawea.

Locals often refer to the golf compound and its surrounds as “Red Mike,” and for good reason. In fact, the course’s cumbersome official name is The Links of North Dakota at Red Mike Resort, though at the moment the “resort” is limited to RV hookups. If the story of Red Mike is true, perhaps the acreage should have been called “Field of Screams.” As the tale is told, the course is built around a hill where Red Mike, an alleged cattle or horse rustler, was set afire by a vigilante mob in the 1880s, yet lived to tell about it. Today, if you’re on fire at Red Mike, it means that you’re mastering the winds, conquering the greens and making birdies in bunches.


In the end, there still wasn’t enough money to get the project off the ground, but as Kay and the others started to review the initial design, they realized they may never get another chance to work on such an amazing, links-like piece of property. So Kay, irrigation contractor Mike Ames and several others waived their fees and accepted ownership interests in what ultimately amounted to a labor of love.

Kay considered a dozen possible routings, then settled on one after a key assist from his design associate, Doug Smith. Natural. Minimalistic. Lay-of-the-land. Low-profile. Whatever label you attach to Kay’s design, the only important thing to know is that The Links of North Dakota is a throwback to another time, when routings fit the land perfectly, as with Shinnecock Hills or the very best courses in the British Isles. On moderately hilly terrain covered with wispy, golden native grasses, Kay incredibly moved only 7,000 cubic yards of dirt—compared with an average American course that features 250,000 yards moved.

“Topography, soil and views,” exclaims Kay, in gushing about the site’s natural attributes. “The contours were so perfect on six of the greens that I just instructed the contractors to leave them alone. We didn’t re-grade them at all.”


Kay was gifted with wonderful, sandy, rock-free loam soil that extended six feet deep, and with stunning lake vistas from every hole on the course. He seeded the greens with bent grass plus a touch of fescue, a combination found on true links. To complete the links experience, fairways were seeded in seaside bent and fescue.

Designed to play firm and fast, The Links of North Dakota also features 45-yard-wide fairways, roughly 50 percent larger than average, to accommodate shots in the usual breezes that prevail. Perhaps the toughest hole on the back nine is the 457-yard, par-4 15th, which is distinguished by a St. Andrews-like 100-yard-wide fairway.

Kay crafted a marvelously flexible par-72 design with five sets of tees. From the tips, the course measures 7,092 yards, with a top-heavy back nine of 3,684 yards. What makes The Links of North Dakota a modern classic, however, is its variety and its bunkering, both of which contribute to the superior strategic options that are sprinkled throughout the course.


An extended visit to Ireland and Scotland (where he stayed at the home of St. Andrews superintendent Walter Woods) infused Kay with a good sense of what should make for a quality links experience. The result is a routing that mixes short holes and long, that offers doglegs in both directions and that takes advantage of the terrain at every opportunity.

Most authentic are the bunkers. They are superbly placed at every turn. Depending on the wind that day, some will come into play—laughably—while the next day, you wouldn’t even give them a second thought—just as on a traditional links. Notably, Kay displayed admirable restraint in designing his bunkers. Not one is superfluous, and they are shaped as simple circles and ovals—exactly what you’d see in the old country.

In another nod to Scotland, Kay has included a North Berwick-style “Redan” hole; here it’s the 232-yard 17th, which plays downhill to a large green placed on a diagonal bias, a green further fortified by bunkers and steep drop-offs. The other par-3s, numbers 3, 8 and 11, are excellent holes as well. Three and 11 measure less than 150 yards and feature shallow greens shored by sod-wall bunkers, while the brutal, all-carry, 185-yard eighth is more modern in feel, with a huge dished green that affords some nearly inaccessible pin placements.

Strong golfers will warm to the 473-yard, par-4 12th, which is graced by a sidehill hogback fairway and a broad, sloping green. Nevertheless, the best two holes come early.

The par-4 second is one of the great 350-yard holes in the nation. A perfectly placed trio of diagonally strewn cross bunkers obscures the landing area, but on days where the wind is “normal,” the fun begins with the approach, which generally is on the short side. With Lake Sakakawea beckoning in the background, the sensible play seems to be the right-center of the green, thereby avoiding the pot bunkers that guard the left-front. But overhit that right-center approach a shade and you’ll bound over the firm green, down a steep slope and into knee-high grass. It’s a tad tricky, and a perfect risk/reward design.

The 560-yard, par-5 seventh doesn’t offer quite the peril of the second hole, but is its equal where strategy is concerned. Seven bends to the right after the tee shot, then heads uphill. The challenge comes from the interesting deception created by the placement of the hole’s eight bunkers. Adding further interest is a swale that creases the putting surface; adding to the pleasure is the pure prairie scenery and utter solitude that characterizes this part of the course.

Ultimately, The Links of North Dakota succeeds brilliantly because it’s completely natural, yet never, ever boring, no matter how many times you play it. Kay laughs wistfully and says that as good as it is, there are no guarantees in life and that it could use an investor or two to make it thrive. “We all left our fees on the table when we built this one,” says Kay. “We did it for the love of the game. Given the design, the peacefulness, the views … we felt that this was a place that would attract true golfers who were willing to take a little extra time to get there.”

The Links of North Dakota at Red Mike Resort is not easy to get to. It is, however, fully worth the journey."
111,Shaker Run Golf Course,non100,"Lebanon, OH",Author Hills,1979,"Shaker Run Golf Club (Lebanon, Ohio)",Bill Satterfield,rev111_shaker_run_1,"The Takeaway:  Shaker Run has several holes with great designs that are plenty enjoyable to play. Unfortunately the conditioning is suffering greatly and the course is in need of renovation to bring it back to life. The surrounding residential development is taking away from the overall setting and tightening some playing corridors, but for under $50 you can play some really fun holes.  Grade C
What to Expect:  Shaker Run is an Arthur Hills design located halfway between Cincinnati and Dayton in southwest Ohio. A one time host of the US Public Links (2005), the course has since fallen on hard times as evidenced by the deplorable conditions. Dead patches are all over the fairways and tees, the course doesn’t drain well and thus gets soggy, many bunkers are completely unmaintained, and the grass patches that exist are thin. It is pretty sad because the bones of the design are good with some great holes to play, but the imposing development of houses and conditioning really detracts from the experience. In addition, the course could really benefit from some tree removal on a handful of holes which would help with playability and overall health of the course. As a highlight, the clubhouse is quite nice and feels much more upscale than the rest of the facilities and gives the club something to build around if a much needed renovation is breathed back into the course. A third nine (known as Meadows or White) was added by Hurdzan and Fry in 1999 but was not evaluated.

Individual Hole Analysis
Signature Hole:  Red 3rd Hole – 423 Yard Par 4 – The dramatic 3rd hole on the Red nine features a tee shot to a raised fairway that then descends out of view where most drives will end up. When you crest the hill to find your ball you are presented with an impressive approach shot view that plays well downhill to a green fronted by a creek, flanked in the rear by bunkers, and pinched on the sides by tree branches that stand ready to swat any shot wavering off line. From tee to green the hole drops about 50 feet in elevation and tee shots over 275 yards will tumble from the first fairway down a steep hill to a second fairway and effectively set up a much shorter approach shot. It is a very memorable hole where accuracy is rewarded more than valor.

Best Par 3:  Red 6th Hole – 203 Yards – With Shaker Creek flanking the left side of the green and a bunker fronting it, the dramatic downhill 5th is as scenic as it is exciting to play. The tee shot plays a full club less than the yardage due to the drop down to the green but make sure you hit is hard enough to clear the water to avoid a double bogey early in the round. It is pretty exciting watching your ball descend to the green with anticipation of how good, or bad, the result may be.

Best Par 4:  Red 9th Hole – 435 Yards – A long cape hole awaits on the finish of the front nine and is as dangerous as it is scenic. Armco Park Lake consumes your view and engulfs that right side of the hole with players having to decide how much water to carry enroute to the fairway that angles away from the player. Finding the fairway is no guarantee of things finishing well as the lake jets back in front of the green and creates another forced carry to contend with. In match play this is a fantastic hole to contend on; in stroke play it makes you nervous.

Best Par 5:  Greeen 4th Hole – 480 Yards – I almost feel guilty calling this a par five when it tips out at 480 yards, but the scorecard doesn't lie. Step one in walking away with a birdie on this gettable hole is to avoid the o.b. that runs runs that entire right side of the fairway and green. The brilliance in the design is sucking the aggressive player into going for the green in two with a tight opening to the green that features three bunkers on the left and o.b. on the right. Players that successfully navigate the trouble will have a great opportunity to take a stroke back from Old Man Par while those that get more greedy than their game can handle will walk away disappointed with the result.

Birdie Time:  Green 8th Hole – 497 Yard Par 5 – Armco Park Lake sets the stage for the next two holes with the par five 8th wrapping to the left around the water. Measuring less than 500 yards, this hole is ripe for the picking as drives up the right side that miss the fairway bunker will be given a great downhill look at the green. The putting surface is protected by a pair of bunkers but that shouldn't discourage you from trying to reach this scenic green in two and give yourself a chance to roll in an eagle. If you don't reach the green on your second shot there is still a great chance to get up and down for a birdie since the putting surface contours are pretty tame which opens the door for you to be plenty aggressive. Beautiful and a scoring opportunity equals a winning combination at Shaker Run for you to enjoy.

Bogey Beware:  Green 9th Hole – 405 Yard Par 4 – The final hole at Shaker Run features an intimidating tee shot from a peninsula tee box resting in the lake. A 250 yard carry is required to reach the skinniest part of the fairway so you are best to layup short of it or bomb it by in an effort to set up a short approach home. The tee shot on a cape hole is always critical because you generally only have room for error on one side of your aiming point so getting off the box safely is critical here. The approach shot plays to a peninsula green with a tree protecting the right side and water tight on the left. This is a pretty hole but can derail a good round quick if you make any mistakes."
112,Shaker Run Golf Course,non100,"Lebanon, OH",Author Hills,1979,SHAKER RUN GOLF CLUB,Two Guys Who Golf,rev112_shake_run_2,"Note: Shaker Run recently completed clubhouse renovations, and has also added 100 new golf carts on property!  The Lakeside nine has experienced complete renovation of their sand bunkers, and the original Woodlands nine as well as the Meadows nine will have similar work completed this spring. New photography will be added to this review this summer, to reflect the beautiful improvements to the course and property.

Shaker Run Golf Club, located in Lebanon, is Ohio's #1 ranked public golf course. This beautiful 27-hole Championship course was voted 83rd out of the top 100 by Golf Digest in 2003, and was also ranked in the top 100 by Travel and Leisure Magazine. In 2005 Shaker Run played host to the U.S. Amateur Public Links Championships. Other Awards include one of Golf Digests best places to play in 2007, with a 4 1/2 star ranking.

On course the Kirby marking system is in place with yardage marked on the fairways every 25 yards from 50 yards to the greens center and out. Sprinkler heads are also marked and measured to center green.

There are four sets of tee boxes to choose from at Shaker Run and the yardage and slope depends upon which 18-hole course is chosen. The Meadows/Lakeside plays the longest with distance ranging from 5046/7091 yards/slopes 118 to 136. The Woodlands/Meadows measures from 5161 to 7072/slopes 119 to 134. The Lakeside/Woodlands is the shortest and measures from 5075 to 6953 with the slope ranging from 121 to 138. Photos in this review were taken from the Lakeside/Woodlands.

On property is a beautiful clubhouse which includes a fully stocked pro shop, locker rooms, and a restaurant and bar. For outings and banquets there is a Grand Ballroom which seats 300 people, and an outdoor pavilion with a beautiful view of the course that can cater to another 200.  Practice facilities feature a targeted grass range, and a large practice green used for putting and chipping.

The 27-hole layout has a total of 70 soft sand bunkers (the bunkers on the Lakeside/Woodlands courses have been totally renovated ) situated near the greens and off the sides of the fairways, and 14 holes feature water in the form of lakes, ponds and streams.   The fairways are tree lined and hilly with undulations that may cause some uneven lies. There are dramatic elevation changes with elevated tees and greens on each nine-hole course. The mildly sloping putting surfaces are well protected by mounding, bunkers, and water hazards, creating challenging approaches from all angles.

This is a great layout - nicely conditioned and highly recommended."
113,Tetherow Golf Club,non100,"Bend, OR",David McLay Kidd,2008,"Tetherow Golf Club (Bend, Oregon)",Bill Satterfield,rev113_tetherow_1,"The Takeaway:  Tetherow is a love hate. I love the aesthetics, unique style, and concept of the course but I hate some of the ridiculous bounces, penalizing approach shots, and overly influential undulations. With some modifications to the course it could be really fun rather than focused on being penal.  Grade B-
What to Expect:  Tetherow is a controversial links style course found southwest of Bend in Central Oregon. The controversy at Tetherow that has existed since opening day and continues to be addressed is the penal nature and number of bunkers, the shapes and undulations in the greens, and the overall playability of the course. The course employs firm fast conditions with bunkers peppered throughout the fairway, some visible and others not, resulting in some tee shots that appear to be great off the club but can sometimes be pushed by the fairway contours into a bunker. Various bunkers have been removed, mounds flattened, and course modifications made in order to increase the playability and enjoyability of the course. Fescue is the grass of choice for the fairways and greens which is ideal for firm conditions however most American golfers are accustomed to flying the ball all the way to the hole which can result in the ball tricking off the back of the greens at Tetherow. Instead, golfers need to learn how to utilize the contours fronting the green to work the ball up towards the hole. One complaint uttered at Tetherow is that good shots are penalized and bad shots are rewarded. In some ways there is truth to that statement, however once you learn to play Tetherow the way it was designed to be played rather than playing it the way you think it should be played then you’ll understand better what style of shots are required to score well. Aesthetically the course is stunning with the fescue grasses, sporadic tree placement, and the high desert mountain scenery all combining to create a lot of eye candy. In the end, there were things that I loved and things that I didn’t care for at Tetherow. I loved the scenery, the options off the tee, and the unique style. I didn’t care for some of the fairway mounding, the erratic results of how the ball would bounce, and the raised greens with sloping edges that are counter-active to a course using firm fast conditions on fescue turf. Forecaddies are provided which is a helpful asset to have when trying to learn the way to play Tetherow which will lead to a much more enjoyable experience.
Individual Hole Analysis
Signature Hole:  17th Hole – 182 Yard Par 3 – When you see pictures of Tetherow in magazines or publications the photo you see most is of the one-shot 17th. ""The Quarry"" hole plays to a green that stretches over 50 yards long but is less than 15 yards wide at most points. A massive waste bunker consumes the foreground with large sand banks frame the hole on each side. The only safe miss is long where a bank that feed a tee shot back onto the putting surface; but that is only a good play when the flag in is the back of this lengthy green. It is kind of a do or die type of hole, so hopefully you've kept something in the tank for a strong finish.
17th Hole at Tetherow Golf Club (182 Yard Par 3)
Best Par 3:  3rd Hole – 197 Yards – While Tetherow mostly feels like a links experience, some American golf comes into play on the 3rd hole with a par three that plays over a pond. A pot bunker fronts the green and encourages you to play to either side of it, but if you choose to fly it then make sure you carry it long enough to clear the downslope on the back side which could propel the ball forward and potentially into the bunker flanking the back of the green. After being given a pretty good birdie opportunity on the 2nd hole, the 3rd is going to require you to be on your game just to card a par.
3rd Hole at Tetherow Golf Club (197 Yard Par 3)
Best Par 4:  6th Hole – 424 Yards – Another split fairway awaits on the 6th, but this time with a greater risk/reward scenario to consider. The safe play is to the right and short of the divide which leaves plenty of fairway to hit but a blind approach with plenty of carry into the green. The bold tee shot up the left side brings the water into play that flanks that side of the fairway but a successful drive leaves a shorter approach with a receptive angle into the putting surface. It is a classic risk/reward opportunity where you have to decide whether you are better with your driver or your irons.
6th Hole at Tetherow Golf Club (424 Yard Par 4)
Best Par 5:  2nd Hole – 546 Yards – The par five 2nd features a split fairway that is divided by a sharp berm that is covered in long grass and bushes. Speed slots are afforded on each side so if you manage to catch one you'll be in great shape for attacking the green in two. Going to the fairway on the right will shorten up the hole but will bring the bunkers into play more that flank the right side of the green. From the left side the perfect approach stays just right of the bunker 50 yards short of the green and bounds its way onto the left side of the putting surface. The ideal layup finishes 75 yard short of the green's center as that clears the berm but stays short of the last set of fairway bunkers.
2nd Hole at Tetherow Golf Club (546 Yard Par 5)
Birdie Time:  10th Hole – 316 Yard Par 4 – An elevated tee shot and not a lot of yardage to cover is the perfect recipe for a birdie, and that is exactly what you get to start the back nine. A pair of bunkers sit in the middle of the fairway 85 yards from the green and as long as you avoid them you should be in good shape. If you stay to the higher right side you can bound your ball onto the putting surface through the opening afforded at the front right, while going up the left side will leave you on a nice flat lie to chip from or feed you to a bowl in front of the green where you can chip or putt from. David McLay Kidd is offering you a gift here, make sure you take advantage of it.
10th Hole at Tetherow Golf Club (316 Yard Par 4)
Bogey Beware:  11th Hole – 466 Yard Par 4 – Hopefully you took a birdie last hole because you make need the extra stroke here at the 11th. The tee shot plays to a fairway that slopes right and pushes balls toward a small grouping of trees that can quickly block your angle into the green if you don't keep your drive far enough left. Trying to cut the corner on this dogleg right is a futile thought for most mortals as it takes over 300 yards of carry and plenty of height to clear the trees guarding the bend. The greensite sheds off approach shots like Teflon with a clear line of attack remaining a mystery except through the sliver of an opening on the right side of the green. This hole is just a brute where big numbers can come into play pretty quickly.

Tetherow Golf Club, located just outside Bend, Oregon, is a tough test of all phases of your game.  Immense replay value.  Lots of fun for the creative shot maker.  Beautiful natural setting.


Introduction
Tetherow Golf Club is not the most famous David McLay-Kidd design in Oregon – that’s Bandon Dunes [review HERE] – but, depending on your taste, it might be his best.  If you’re looking for a firm, fast test of your ball striking and strategy, it’s time to head to Bend, Oregon.


Practice Facilities
The practice facilities at Tetherow Golf Club aren’t just excellent, they’re visually stunning.  Most driving ranges stand apart from the course – wide, flat, dull.  When I first got to Tetherow, I thought that the driving range was part of the course – that’s how much effort was put into matching the aesthetics of the range to the course.  Also, the putting greens are elevated, giving you great views to go with all the slopes you need to prep for the course.


On the practical side, the driving range is a adjacent to the first tee, which is exactly where it belongs.  There are two sides to the range, so it might require a short drive to hit balls.  The two practice putting greens – one under construction at the time of this writing – are located just behind the range.  Finally, Tetherow has one of the best short game areas I’ve seen.  This area has all the wild elevation that you’ll see on the course, so you can get your short game truly prepared.

Fun fact: the driving range turns into a par 3 course on Mondays…and it’s free to play!


Amenities & Customer Service
Tethrow Golf Club offers players traditional golf carts – with excellent GPS units – as well as Finn Scooters.  I’m a huge fan of the Finn Scooter [review HERE], and I saw more golfers on Finn Scooters than in golf carts at Tetherow.  This makes sense since Tetherow has the largest fleet of Finns anywhere.

The pro shop is fairly compact and more focused on soft goods than hard goods.  You’ll be able to find a replacement putter but not a full set.  There is also a drive thru turn stand where you can refuel for the back nine.

While the Tetherow Golf Club is a first-tier course, Tetherow Resort has much more to offer.  There are three restaurants – I ate at The Row numerous times and never got tired of it – an outstanding fitness facility, a pool, miles of hiking and bike trails, and much more.  The hotel rooms are spacious and well appointed, and there are rental homes if you want more space.  There are only 50 hotel rooms at Tetherow Resort, which gives the place a great feel – intimate, never crowded.


Beauty & Scenery
Tetherow Golf Club is in a unique spot.  It sits on 700 acres that borders the Deschutes National Forest but is just minutes from downtown Bend.  Both elements are on display, as you’ll see quite a few houses on the course (safely set back from play) as well as the Cascade Mountain Range.


The real star of the show is the dramatic movement of the land.  This high desert landscape was left rough and wild.  What I love about this look is that it’s directly related to the way the course plays.  The slopes and elevations not only entertain your eye, they’re also what tests your game.


Tee Shots
A player might look at the wide fairways of Tetherow Golf Club and think, “This course is generous off the tee.”  Another player could see the forced carries and waste areas full of plants and think, “This course is tough off the tee.”  Neither player is entirely right or wrong.  Off the tee, Tetherow is a mixed bag.


I rated almost every fairway at Tetherow as “Wide” and just one hole as below average in width.  But that doesn’t tell the entire story.  The fairways snake left and right, split and dead end.  There are definitely holes where you can swing away, but most demand that you choose a specific line and distance.  If you’re really precise with your drives, you can gain huge advantages by using the slopes to gain distance.  In our group, one player hit a 400 yard drive on #2.


Missing the fairways comes with a steep price.  While you can find your ball in the waste areas, you won’t find them all.  You might draw a playable lie, but it’s more likely that your ball will be suspended in a shrub.  There are numerous center-line hazards at Tetherow, but, for the most part, you’re better off in a fairway bunker than taking your chances with the waste areas.

Tetherow Golf Club offers players five sets of tees ranging from 7,283 to 5,230 yards.  There are also three sets of combo tees.  The fairways are fast and firm, which can add distance to your drives, but you should also take into account the wind.  While I would not say that length is a major factor at Tetherow, you can make it one by biting off more than you can comfortably chew.


Approach Shots
The fairways at Tetherow Golf Club are firm and fast with undulations that range from subtle to enormous.  Unless you find a divot, your ball will have a perfect lie, but your stance is likely to be less than ideal – uphill, downhill, or sidehill.   Getting comfortable over the ball is just the first part of the challenge.


Next, you’ll need to deal with elevation changes and wind.  It’s rare that you’ll ever play the GPS yardage on an approach shot.  The elevation changes range from modest to “I’m supposed to hit it up there?!”  Beyond adding distance, those uphill shots can take away your vision of the target.


The final piece of the approach shot puzzle is the green.  Tetherow Golf Club has uniformly large greens, but they’re heavily segmented and undulating.  You can easily hit a green in regulation but be a long way from a par.


With the course playing firm and fast, the ground game is available on most holes.  The caveat is that you need to make a choice.  If you’re going to use the slopes and play a running shot, you need to commit to that path.  Alternately, you can play a precise, target golf shot, but it needs to be really high with plenty of spin.  Taking the middle route – average trajectory with no plan for what happens on the ground – is the fastest way to missed greens.


Greens & Surrounds
The surrounds at Tetherow Golf Club are just like the rest of the course: big, bold, dramatic.  There are perilous false fronts, towering mounds, and steep drops off the sides of greens.  Large, wild bunkers protect many of the greens.  Though the bunkers are often the focal point visually, more strokes will be lost to slopes than sand.


While there are spots of light rough, the majority of the surrounds are tight and fast like the fairways, leaving you the ability to putt from almost any distance.  The speed of the playing surfaces and the size of the undulations allows for tremendous creativity on and around the greens.  During our round, numerous shots were played well away from the cup to utilize a friendly slope.


The greens are outstanding, running at a smooth 10 or 11 on the Stimpmeter.  This enhances the effects of the large undulations, making every lengthy putt an adventure.  Putting from one segment of a green to another can feel more challenging than an approach to an island green.  The reads are not difficult, but you need to have your speed under control.


While great shotmaking and precision are always useful, the critical ability around the greens of Tetherow Golf Club is discipline.  During your round, you will face situations where you need to take your medicine.  That might be a chip that’s likely to run back down a false front.  It could be a birdie putt you can’t be aggressive with.  Whatever it is, make the smart play immediately and get on to the next shot.  Trying to fight this course is not going to be good for your score.


Overall Design
Tetherow Golf Club is a litmus test for who you are and what you like in a golf course.  If you like playing the victim, you won’t like this course.  You’ll have ample opportunities to whine when your “perfect” shot rolls off the green.  However, if you appreciate the ground game, creativity, and the natural interplay of luck and skill in golf, Tetherow could easily be in your personal top five.


The day that I played Tetherow Golf Club, the wind was blowing unusually hard, according to the staff.  For me, this just added to the fun.  The course absolutely wore me out, but I had a smile on my face the whole time.  But perhaps I’m a golf masochist.


Regardless of your taste, what you must appreciate about Tetherow Golf Club is its immense replay-ability.  Because the greens are so big and have so much character, a new set of pin positions means an entirely different playing experience.  Couple that with the flexibility in the tee boxes and you can easily see why the members never get sick of this course.


The other thing that makes Tetherow a great home course is the depth of the local knowledge.  Some courses give up all their secrets after one round.  Tetherow Golf Club is not one of them.  Every time around this track, you’re going to find a new wrinkle to avoid or take advantage of on future trips.


Favorite Holes
#2 – Par 5 – 546 Yards

Looking at the flyover, the second hole seems fairly normal – a medium length par 5 with a divided fairway.  In person, the amount of elevation change is jaw dropping.  Depending on the distance and line of your drive, you can have a long, blind second shot or a wedge to set up eagle.  And like virtually every hole at Tetherow Golf Club, getting to the green is only half the battle.


#6 – Par 4 – 424 Yards

The sixth hole also features a split fairway.  Playing to the right limits how far you can drive it, and it takes away your view of the green.  Going to the left gives you a better shot, but it brings water into play.  You can also hit it perfectly straight and end up in the garbage like I did.  This is a hole that you’ll want to play again the minute you putt out.

#7 – Par 3 – 226 Yards

This hole made the cut for its green and its tee boxes.  It’s only a long par 3 if you’re playing one of the back two tee boxes – it drops to 163 for the middle tees.  This is something more courses should do.  The green is a masterwork, encapsulating everything that’s fun and maddening about Tetherow Golf Club.  To get a great result, you need a solid plan and precise execution.


Conclusion
If you’re up for a challenge and you enjoy putting your creativity to work on the course, Tetherow Golf Club is a must-play.  This is a gorgeous course that’s going to test every part of your game while giving you the opportunity to fashion shots you wouldn’t be able to play anywhere else."
115,Lookaway Golf Club,non100,"Buckingham, PA",Rees Jones,1999,"Lookaway Golf Club (Buckingham, Pennsylvania)",Bill Satterfield,rev115_lookaway_1,"The Takeaway:  Lookaway is a solid parkland offering in the greater Philadelphia area that is highlighted by a half dozen holes that stand out among the rest, including the final half of the inward nine. Conditioning and playability are an emphasis at the club where you'll find pure turf and a course that caters to all handicap levels.  Grade B
What to Expect:  Located 30 miles north of Philadelphia and just 20 miles west of Trenton, NJ, Lookaway Golf Club finds itself in historic Bucks County which is bordered by the famed Delaware River. Lookaway is a Rees Jones design where the club emphasizes two main things; playability and a caddie program. The course is one of the most playable courses you'll find, until you get to the 18th, and thus attracts a membership with a lot more ladies and high handicappers than you'll find at prestigious Philadelphia area clubs Merion and Aronimink. The gentle moving terrain creates a very walkable course and helps the caddie program thrive although players also have the option of riding a cart if they wish. Kudos are given to the course superintendent that keeps that turf in impeccable shape which is aided by the fact that the club invested in sand capping their fairways and greens to improve drainage. Ultimately the course is characterized with the 4th and 7th highlighting the opening 13 holes before Lookaway unveils its impressive five hole closing stretch. In fact, if the entire course were up to caliber with the final quintuple of holes, Lookaway would have an argument of being a top 100 course; but alas, it simply isn't the case much like many other solid courses outside the grasps of greatness. In the end, Lookaway is a good golf course that isn't overly difficult, enjoys nice surroundings, and is a pleasant course to enjoy on a daily basis.
Individual Hole Analysis
Signature Hole:  7th Hole – 399 Yard Par 4 – The best hole on the front nine and one of the signature designs on the property, the 7th hole is a dogleg left with a risk/reward element. A 250 yard drive straight away will tumble your ball into one of the bunkers sitting on the outside corner of the dogleg which begs longer hitters to challenge the trees on the inside corner and cut some serious yards off. A 300 yard downhill bomb over the trees will leave you just a flip wedge over a creek and into the green. A lone bunker frames the entire right side of the putting surface and stands as the last defense of this hole that patrons look forward to playing each time around Lookaway.
7th Hole at Lookaway Golf Club (399 Yard Par 4)
Best Par 3:  15th Hole – 170 Yards – Playing slightly uphill, the 15th features a wide but relatively shallow putting surface to attack with a large menacing bunker fronting the entire green. Short and long are both bad misses, so the sacrifice is with accuracy rather than distance control on this one-shotter which makes club selection vital as ever. I really like when a course features at least one uphill par three and Lookaway comes through with this offering; a simple but effective hole as the final par three on the course.
15th Hole at Lookaway Golf Club (170 Yard Par 3)
Best Par 4:  14th Hole – 477 Yards – This is where Lookaway gets really good. The impressive five finishing holes kicks off with this stout two-shotter. The tee shot plays downhill to a landing area framed on the left side by a nearly 100 yard long bunker that terminates at a pond. Bailing out to the right will bring the heavy rough into play and potentially block you out from reaching the green in two as trees encroach in from that side. The green is protected by a trio of bunkers on the right and a single sand hazard on the left which leaves a dead straight approach as your only safe play. Pars here are rare, and if you manage to card one, pat yourself on the back and keep your foot on the gas for the final four holes.
14th Hole at Lookaway Golf Club (477 Yard Par 4)
Best Par 5:  17th Hole – 523 Yards – Lookaway's best par five is also a great chance to card a birdie; gaining a stroke you are likely to give back on the closer. At just 523 yards and doglegging left, this hole can be reached in two for many players. A 275 yard rip towards the left side of the fairway bunkers will keep you short of trouble and open up the ideal angle to the green. From here, less than 240 yards is needed to reach the front of the putting surface. A more aggressive line off the tee will obviously shorten up the approach shot distance which may be a welcome approach considering there are ten bunkers lacing the outside of the fairway enroute to the green. Whether you go for the green in two or decide to lay up, you'll need to carry the environmentally sensitive hazard area that crosses the fairway about 175 yards from the front edge of the green. It is a good scoring opportunity with its fair share of risks to contend with; just what you like to see in a par five.
17th Hole at Lookaway Golf Club (523 Yard Par 5)
Birdie Time:  4th Hole – 387 Yard Par 4 – The first time that Lookaway really grabs your attention is with the par four 4th hole that bends right from tee to green. The tee shot plays over a creek where players will want to favor the left side of the fairway in order to avoid the quintuple of bunkers sitting in the lowlands right of the fairway. The short approach shot plays to a large green which greatly increases your chances at a green in regulation. Getting off the tee is the whole key here, once you stripe your drive then a birdie is begging you to come take it.
4th Hole at Lookaway Golf Club (387 Yard Par 4)
Bogey Beware:  18th Hole – 434 Yard Par 4 – The closing hole at Lookaway is one of the most challenging in the state. While 434 yards doesn't sound too intimidating, players are faced with a tee shot, not necessarily with a driver, to an island fairway before hitting an uphill approach shot over a meadowland to an elevated greensite protected by a collection of bunkers along the hillside. It is the toughest green in regulation for the day due to the severity of the climb to the putting surface, difficulty of judging the distance, and getting your ball to hold the green given the angle of attack. In match play, this is a fine finisher that is a tough to close an opponent out on. In stroke play, this can ruin a good round if you don't respect it.

116,Lookaway Golf Club,non100,"Buckingham, PA",Rees Jones,1999,LOOKAWAY GC,Phil Sokol,rev116_lookaway_2,"HISTORY: When crafting a golf course, several ingredients need to come to
fruition.
First, a quality site, second, a team of individuals dedicated to seeing the
project through from start to finish, and finally, an architect with a stellar
reputation in the design business.
To say Lookaway Golf Club hit the jackpot in all three categories would be an
understatement.
History has the property dating back to 1713, when Commonwealth of
Pennsylvania founder and Englishman William Penn deeded the land to Thomas
Watson of Yorkshire, England. The building, an 18th Century Manor House, which
was erected during the mid-1700s, was used as a home and a schoolhouse. It
currently serves as the clubhouse and is believed to be the oldest building in
the country used as a clubhouse. In addition, the deed (Deed No. 1) created
was the first of its kind in Buckingham Township, Pa.
Over the next three centuries, ownership of the land changed hands on several
occasions and in 1923 the Paxon family of Edward and Albert sold the dairy
farm to Theodore W. Sterling. Known then as the Paxon Farm, Sterling renamed
the property Lookaway and maintained the business of a milk farm, which was
known as one of the few places in which fresh milk could be purchased. In
fact, the bottles of milk sported the club's actual logo, which incorporates
Sterling's initials.
Fast forward to 1997, when the Lookaway Golf Club partners, led by Harry
Ferguson, Bruce McKissock and Bill Black, purchased the site from the Sterling
family. A handshake was all that was needed to make sure that the logo would
remain as a symbol of this historic property.
The final piece of the puzzle was hiring an architect who could bring out the
beauty of the 207 acres and craft a venue worthy to be called a world-class
golf course.
Who else but the ""Open Doctor,"" Rees Jones.
Son of one of the greatest golf course architects of our time, Robert Trent
Jones, Rees has built a reputation of remodeling and renovating some of the
greatest U.S. Open and PGA Championship courses in the United States, such as
Congressional CC (Blue), Medinah CC (Course No. 3), Hazeltine National,
Atlanta Athletic Club (Highlands Course), Baltusrol GC (Lower), The Country
Club and Bethpage Black, to name a few.
In addition, since 1974, Rees has been crafting some of his own signature
designs, such as Ocean Forest GC (Sea Island, Ga.), Atlantic GC
(Bridgehampton, N.Y.), Haig Point Club (Daufuskie Island, S.C.) and Huntsville
GC (Shavertown, Pa.), all of which have been rated as America's 100 Best
Modern Courses by many publications.
The rich landscape of the region created a great canvas for Jones to work on.
""We bought three different parcels which we thought would be ideal for a golf
course for this area,"" Jones said. ""When it was open, we did a little more
framing with mounds. When it was wooded, we used trees as frames, so we really
have very distinct types of golf holes. We moved a little more dirt where
there were less trees and the land dictated it.""
In this day and age of moving hundreds of thousands of yards of dirt to mold a
course, Jones was able to use this rustic property to shape a venue to enhance
the land. ""A lot of the historical aspects were maintained to uphold the
integrity of the building,"" he said. ""We really cared about the land. It had
great topography. It has wetlands, which had to be incorporated into our
design environmentally, but it all meshed very well.""
Since it's opening in 1999, Lookaway Golf Club has climbed in stature and is
now rated as one of the top-20 courses in Pennsylvania. Quite high praise
considering the rich golf history of the region.
""I think it stacks up to the best courses in Pennsylvania, because it's
playable,"" Jones added. ""The green contours at Lookaway are fun. The course
has the challenge, but it's fair and you can score. But in many cases, if you
don't manage your game or play the proper angles, it can be a little more
difficult. You have to think your way around Lookaway.""
While some golf courses go through an adjustment period after opening,
Lookaway has had very little changed since day one.
""We really haven't done much tweaking at Lookaway,"" Jones said. ""We spent a
lot of time there working with the partners and Dave Renk the superintendent,
and they were with us every step of the way, so we designed the course to
everyone's pleasure at the outset. There's false chipping areas and a short-
game area that have been built since the beginning and the practice area has
been enlarged, but for the most part, the golf course is intact from 14 years
ago.""
Lookaway Golf Club has hosted a pair of premium local events, the 2008
Philadelphia Open and the prestigious Brewer Cup in 2013.
Dating back to 1903, the Philadelphia Open has a rich history and was captured
by Rich Steinmetz with a one-round score of 67, while the Brewer Cup was won
by Robin McCool, a 2 & 1 winner over Michael Quinn. Not only did Quinn survive
an eight-for-one sudden death playoff just to qualify for the match-play
portion, but he knocked off medalist Chip Lutz in the first round en route to
becoming the first two-time winner of this event.
HOLE-BY-HOLE REVIEW: The opening hole at Lookaway Golf Club is as easy as it
gets ... well, almost. Although just 378 yards from the tips, the drive
requires accuracy, as water looms large left and thick rough/fescue stands
guard right. For your approach, you need to be spot on, even if you're using
just a wedge, as the entire left side is flanked by water and right is sand.
Let's not forget the putting surface is two-tiered and long, so pick the right
club for your second. A back-left pin looks great, but must be avoided,
otherwise you might make a big number right out of the gate.
Lookaway is a great walking course; however, the stroll to the second is a bit
peculiar, as you walk slightly back toward the clubhouse, roughly 300 yards.
""Nobody seems to complain about that walk,"" Jones said. ""I guess they still
have their energy.""
The only par-3 over 200 yards, the second plays downhill from the tee to a
well-guarded green. A creek cuts in front of the putting surface, but it's the
deep bunker on the front-left section that creates plenty of havoc. The green
angles from right to left with very little movement. The key here is club
selection, as long will make for a next-to-impossible up and down, while short
and left brings bogey into play.
Number three is the first par-5 on the course. At 572 yards, it's the second
longest at Lookaway, but this dogleg right plays slightly shorter than the
yardage indicates. The critical play is the tee ball that must avoid the
bunkers on either side of the landing area. If you can carry the ball 250
yards, then try to cut the right-corner of the dogleg to give yourself the
best chance at getting home in two. If that's not your style, then play to the
right of the fairway trap on your approach and you'll have a simple, downhill
pitch to the green. The real trouble lies with the putting surface, as it
reaches 44 paces in depth, with Biarritz-style feel. Bunkers on either side of
the green sit well below the surface, so saving par might be tricky.
One of the several signature holes at Lookaway is the beautiful fourth. Just
362 yards in length, this dogleg right features a forced carry over a creek
and rough to an uphill landing area. Several well-placed bunkers sit well-
below the fairway to the right and must be avoided to have any hope of getting
on in regulation. A successful tee shot will leave a medium to short iron
approach to a fairly large green, dissected in the center by a large, left-to-
right rise. Miss long or right and you'll be faced with a blind, uphill pitch.
If you haven't figured it out yet, short at Lookaway does not mean easy!
The first of four par-4s over 400 yards in length, the fifth possesses one of
the bigger fairways on the course, as the hole bends sharply to the right.
That's the good news. The bad news, a half-dozen bunkers flank the left, and,
two, deep traps protect the right, making this a must-hit landing area. Now
it's your approach with a mid-iron to a kidney-shaped green, 34 paces in
length. Sand on either side of this narrow, tiered surface tightens your shot
even more.
Next up on the front nine is the par-3 sixth. A medium-lengthed hole that
plays uphill from tee to green. Just 182 yards long, make sure you take an
extra stick to compensate for the climb to the putting surface. In addition,
the green is 41 yards long with severe movement throughout. Finally, the
series of traps on the right are diabolical, so make sure you avoid the
sandbox.
The seventh is another favorite of the author. Downhill from tee to green,
this par-4 sweeps from right to left, reaching 399 yards in length. Two
fairway bunkers are a good aiming point, as you move your three-metal from
right to left. Trees guard the left side and may block your approach if you
try to cut the corner. A level lie on this fairway is highly unlikely, so be
prepared as you approach the green. The putting surface sits well below the
fairway, so choosing the correct club is quite a challenge. Speaking of a
test, the green is quite large with a secondary tier in the back, a creek in
the front and sand to the right. Did I miss anything? Good luck!
Number eight is a dogleg left par-5 that stretches to 542 yards. Your tee ball
is the key to conquering this hole, as it must favor the left side, avoiding
the 100-yard bunker down the right. Mounding left to the green is not
favorable either, so be on point. A big tee shot can afford you the
opportunity to get home in two, but stay left, otherwise more sand awaits.
This is a real birdie opportunity, so even if you can't reach in two, you'll
be able to spin a wedge close on this minuscule green.
Another birdie chance awaits as you reach the ninth tee, one of the shortest
par-4s on the course. Fairway metal off the tee should suffice, as sand crimps
the landing area at the 140-yard mark. Your approach is slightly uphill to the
smallest green on the course, just 27 paces in length and less in width. A
near pin brings both fronting traps into play, so shoot past the flag and spin
back toward the hole.
No rest for the weary upon reaching the 10th, although this is the shortest
par-4 on the course at just 341 yards in length. The key here is the tee ball
on this dogleg right. With thick rough flanking either side and a massive sand
box on the right, you'll need to be spot on off the tee, so take less than the
big stick from the start. A short iron should be enough to attack the green,
but be careful, as the two-tiered putting surface, although long at 38 paces,
is quite narrow. Missing long and right will spell T-R-O-U-B-L-E.
The one-shotter 11th is all about accuracy. Playing slightly downhill off the
tee, you'll need to pick the correct stick, as the green is guarded on either
side by sand. The green itself, with a rise in the center, is only 29 paces in
depth. Protected by the wooded terrain, this hole can play quite difficult,
especially with a back-left pin and a swirling wind through the trees.
The 12th starts a string of holes that will test the best of players right
through to the picturesque finale. This par-4, although it reaches less than
400 yards, features plenty of challenge, starting right with the tee shot.
With the earthy tree line on the right and the thick fescue bordering the
right, your opening shot needs to be placed in the short grass. Toss in some
of the white granules on the left and the landing area is narrowed just a bit.
The real fun now begins, as your approach must carry a pond and sand on the
right portion of the small and slick putting surface. Miss right or long to a
back-right pin and you'll have little chance of making par, let alone bogey.
At 585 yards, the par-5 13th is certainly the longest hole on the course and
is significantly more difficult, as it plays uphill from tee to green. The
snake-like fairway has two distinct sections, as the first is tree lined,
while the second section is wide open with guarding fescue. Sand will not
affect your tee shot; however, when laying up, avoid the 50-yard bunker down
the left. As you continue your green ward climb, remember to take enough stick
to reach the putting surface. The green itself is one of the most benign on
the course, so stay below the hole and you'll increase your chance of birdie.
There's good reason why the 14th is the most difficult hole at Lookaway. First
off, 477 yards from the back markers. Second, a 200-yard carry over wetlands
to reach the fairway. Thirdly, a 90-yard bunker guards the left side of the
landing area, while trees and mounding guard the right. Piece of cake ... not.
Despite the elevated tee box, this hole will play every bit of its length and
even with a successful tee shot, you'll need a long iron to reach the green as
the hole bends to the left. The putting surface is quite large, so make sure
you have the correct number to get home. One of the many visually beautiful
and intimidating holes on the course.
Although it's the shortest hole on the course, the 15th is not without its
difficulties. Playing slightly uphill from the tee, with trees flanking either
side, this par-3 is hardly a pushover. Wind and the topography will dictate
your club selection, so you really need to be spot on, as a deep menacing
bunker covers the front. Miss long and you'll sit well below the putting
surface, which is just 29 paces in depth, but quite wide. Short and right is
not a bad spot to miss, especially with a keen short game.
The rock-solid closing stretch continues on the par-4 16th, a medium-length
hole of 408 yards. Bending slightly to the right, your tee shot must carry
over 200 yards of wetlands to reach the accommodating fairway. Avoid the long
bunker on the right and you're just about home free. Your approach must be
struck with precision, as a hollow and deep bunker reside on the right of this
long putting surface. The green is dissected in the rear by a large ridge, so
play center cut for a routine par. With just a couple holes remaining, this is
not time to get cute.
Your final birdie chance comes in the form of the 17th, a sharp, dogleg left
par-5 that reaches just 523 yards from the back markers. The key to conquering
this reachable hole is the tee shot. The preferable play is a draw off the
right fairway bunkers which will run with the contours of the landing area.
The player is now faced with two decisions, whether to lay up or not. Either
way, you'll need to carry the environmentally sensitive area that starts at
the 190-yard mark. Laying up will require just a medium iron to a fairly wide
section around the 100-yard mark. Going for the green will be a bit of a
challenge, as the fairway tightens significantly as you get closer to the
flag. Bunkers down the right and left sides starting at 140 yards away will
get your attention. The green is fairly long with a ridge near the front, but
this surface can be had. One word of caution: Avoid the moat-like bunker that
wraps around the green and your chances of making par or better will increase.
As good as the first 17 holes are at Lookaway Golf Club, the ""piece de
resistance"" has to be the 18th. A sensational par-4 and the second longest on
the course, the finale is as good as any in the region, except maybe the
closer at Merion East. The first chore is the tee shot, which at first look
seems to be tougher than it is, as the shape of the fairway makes the landing
area look smaller than it is. Having said that, you'll still need to bust your
driver down the right side to take advantage of the slope of the fairway. This
also will help you avoid the sand left and don't forget the wetlands you must
carry off the tee. Now the real difficulty of 18, your approach. Playing
straight uphill and to the left, your second shot must carry wetlands and a
cluster of bunkers wedged into the hillside. This is a two-club hill, so take
the machismo out of it and pull the extra stick. The two-tiered green slopes
quickly from back to front and is just 32 paces in depth, so if you can, stay
below the hole and who knows, maybe you'll make par.
FINAL WORD: Certainly not long by today's standards at just under 7,000 from
the back markers, Lookaway Golf Club has the play and feel of a championship
golf course.
Despite the somewhat short numbers, Lookaway can definitely pack a punch.
You'll need to maneuver your ball in and around the course to have any chance
of making pars, let alone birdies. But, Lookaway is not just for the
accomplished player. The forward or Gold tees are just over 5,000 yards and
with the mixed-courses menu of playing different markers on each hole, you
have seven different options.
However, what really sets Lookaway apart is its variety and style of holes.
From the shear beauty of the fourth, to the dogleg left seventh or the
magnificent 18th, you'll be left with a quite memorable round.
""Four is one of those really distinct and wonderful holes,"" Jones said. ""I am
a big fan of Merion and I think Lookaway is a lot like Merion, in which it has
a lot of short par-4 and seven is like the 11th at Merion with the creek in
front and 18 is similar to the second shot into the 18th green at Pine Valley,
with all of that bunkering.""
When strolling the immaculate fairways, you get the feeling you're playing a
course that has been around for 50 years. Such a natural, and almost
undisturbed sense that the course resonates.
""The naturalism of the site is what I believe we accomplished at Lookaway,""
Jones added. ""The framing we did with the mounding on 12 and 13 and 1 and 10
and 3 and 8, we sort of did that, so that every time you're on a hole, you
almost don't think you're anywhere else. You're isolated from the rest of the
golf course. I think we accomplished that and it is quite an achievement to
feel that, that every time you're on a hole, you're not interacting with
people playing other holes.""
In addition, with just over 220 members, you'll never feel pressured while
playing your round of golf. A casual walk in the park, with no tee times, no
hassles ... just golf at its best.
Hand picked by Jones for the job, Renk, who has a pretty good pedigree himself
(formerly at Pine Valley), has been with Lookaway since day one and has
protected and preserved every aspect of Jones' intentions.
Jones certainly doesn't shy away from his feelings about Lookaway.
""Every hole, because of the topography and because of the wetlands and wooded
holes and the openness, are all distinctly different. Lookaway is really a
finesse golf course, which is probably why it has so many members that have
stayed around from the beginning, because you don't have to be a long hitter
to enjoy this course.""
Beginning with the 14th, Jones felt this was the best stretch of holes at
Lookaway. ""You really reach a great crescendo with 14 through 18. Sixteen is a
heck of a par-4. Seventeen is a great chance to make up ground, as it's the
shortest par-5 on the course, and 18 is a great finishing hole.""
The bottom line is that the membership are the ones who need to be satisfied
with the design, more than the architect, because they are the ones playing it
on a regular basis.
Jones said it best about Lookaway and his designs:
""The satisfaction really comes from both restoring or redesigning or building
new ones when it's really well accepted by the membership, as it has been by
the membership of Lookaway. There are two different ways to look at it, the
U.S. Opens and the PGAs, they want their championship courses to be a great
test for the best in the game and my other clients, where I build new courses,
they want the course to be as enjoyable and a great test for the everyday
player.""
""I believe we accomplished that at Lookaway.""

117,Blackwolf Run,non100,"Kohler, WI",Pete Dye,1989,BLACKWOLF RUN,Phil Sokol,rev117_blackwolf_run_1,"HISTORY: So Herb Kohler calls Pete Dye and says (paraphrasing), ""I have this
wonderful piece of property and I want you to create a masterpiece with
unlimited funds."" Well, I'm sure that's not exactly what transpired, but close
enough.

Dye, who's crafted some of the most amazing courses around the world, such as
Casa de Campo, TPC at Sawgrass, Oak Tree, the Ocean Course at Kiawah Island
and Harbour Town, worked closely with Mr. Kohler in an effort to create magic
in ""America's Dairyland.""

""We tried to create courses that are a test to the professional but enjoyable
to the average player as well,"" said Dye. Read on and you'll see that he was
true to his word, but first, a little history lesson (compliments of
destinationkohler.com) is in order.

The course was named after Black Wolf, a chief of the Winnebago Indians (now
known as the Ho-Chunk Nation). According to Gustave Buchen's local history,
""Historic Sheboygan County,"" the Chippewa and Menominee Indians joined forces
to drive out the Winnebagoes. Their intent was to occupy this splendid,
beautiful hunting ground. Several battles were fought, and although the
Winnebagoes were outnumbered, Black Wolf led his band up the mouth of the
river, waded up the shallow water of the lakeshore and overtook his enemies.
Black Wolf was a prominent chief in the history of the Winnebagoes in
Wisconsin during the early 1800s.

Dye began his work in 1985, and although most of the midwest charm was left
intact, many of his trademarks were incorporated throughout the venue, such as
pot bunkers, undulating greens and his famous railroad tie usage.

Opened in June of 1988, the layout featured an 18-hole course, with an
additional nine added to the Meadow Valleys course in July 1989 and the fourth
nine completed in August of 1990.

When the United States Golf Association made its inaugural visit in 1998 for
the Women's Open Championship, the original back nine of the Valleys course
was used for the front nine, while assorted holes from the current River
course were used for the closing section. Holes 11 through 18 of the Meadow
Valleys course were used for holes 2-9, while holes 1-4 of the River and 14-18
were the ones chosen for the back side. The original hole of the Meadow
Valleys course, which is no longer in use, was the opening hole of the
Championship. The layout for the Championship was 6,300 yards at a par of 71
and when all was said and done, Korean Se Ri Pak earned the victory.

Pak, who became the youngest player at the age of 20 to win the Women's Open,
defeated amateur Jenny Chuasiriporn in a playoff. Both players finished
regulation at 290 (six-over-par). How difficult was the course? Only eight
players broke 70, with the low round being 68 by three players. In fact,
during the final round, just one player broke par, as Lorie Kane carded a one-
under 70. The 1988 Championship proved to be quite a dramatic affair, as
Chuasiriporn sank an improbable 40-foot birdie putt on the final hole of
regulation to force a playoff. After both players finished the 18-hole playoff
with rounds of 73, the duo continued on in the first sudden-death finish in
the history of the event. On the second extra hole, Pak sank a 15-foot birdie
putt for the win.

In 1995, the River Course was selected as site of the Andersen Consulting
World Championship of Golf, the precursor to the current WGC events. The U.S.
portion of the event was won by Mark McCumber. The following year, the event
returned to the River Course, and Greg Norman captured the International
section of the Championship. When the Championship returned in 1997, Ernie Els
defeated Steve Elkington in the title match of the International bracket.

Over the years, the courses at Blackwolf Run have been recognized as some of
the nation's finest layouts. In fact, when the River Course opened for play,
Golf Digest awarded the venue as the Best New Public Course.

When Pete Dye first saw the proposed site for the project, he responded,
""There could not be a better natural setting for golf."" High praise from
someone who boasts nine designs in the top-100 of the greatest courses in the
United States.

REVIEW:  MEADOW VALLEYS COURSE  - Pete Dye starts you off nice and easy on the
opening  hole of the Meadow Valleys course. Just a simple par four of just 392
yards,  this is where you decide which tee box you want to play from. From the
tips, the hole bends slightly to the right and requires a 237-yard tee shot to
clear  the pond down  the right. From the blue markers its just 213 yards. The
rolling  fairway  features a pair  of 22- to 26-yard  bunkers on the left that
must  be avoided  if you're to start  your round right. Just a short-iron will
remain to a kidney-shaped green, just 27 yards in depth. Sand, short-right and
deep, guards the wide, narrow putting surface to keep you on your toes.

The  straightaway second  provides  for an  ample landing  area  off the  tee,
although  a  pair of left-side  bunkers certainly  come into play. The fairway
feeds  down towards  the center, leaving the player with an uphill approach to
an elevated and bunkerless green. Miss short and left and you'll find yourself
situated  well  below the putting surface,  making for a very difficult up and
down.  The  sloping green  can be  tricky, especially with  a pin tucked back-
left.

The first par three on the course is just 179 yards in length, but it requires
pinpoint control, as four deep bunkers guard the putting surface. Although the
green  is fairly flat, hitting the promised land could be quite another story,
as the open area brings the elements into play.

At  565 yards, one would think that the par-five fourth would be out of reach,
but  that's what risk-reward  is all about. Bending hard to the right, the key
is  the tee shot,  which must avoid the enormous bunker standing in the middle
of  the fairway.  There is plenty of room  to the left -- laving a nice three-
shot  hole -- or go to the right sliver of a landing area to leave a chance of
getting  home in two. It's risky, especially with the three pot bunkers on the
right,  but  it's possible. The  green is uphill  and hidden behind mounds, so
favor  the left  to avoid  the  sneaky pot  bunker fronting  the surface.  The
putting  green is the  smallest on the course and rolls from back to front, so
any shot below the pin leaves a great shot at birdie.

A  beautiful par four,  the fifth bends to the right and then back to the left
to  a tight,  tree-squeezed  putting surface.  Another  generous landing  area
awaits the player, but driver might not be the call, as the fairway narrows as
you  near the  green. At the 75-yard  mark, trees on both sides of the fairway
make your approach much more difficult. The putting surface is long and narrow
with sand left and right, so accuracy is keen.

The  S-shaped sixth is the hardest hole on the course, reaching 470 yards from
the  black buttons.  The ideal  tee shot  favors the  left side,  however that
brings  the  two fairway bunkers  into play. A mid-  to long-iron remains to a
very  large  and undulating putting surface  with two deep traps on the right.
Bail out left and you'll end up in the chipping area. Certainly an easier spot
to make par than the bunkers.

One  of the  easiest holes on the  course, the seventh is a very reachable par
five  of  just 520 yards. Having  said that, you'll  still need to play a draw
down  the left  side avoiding sand and  thick underbrush, not to mention a big
trap  guarding  the right fairway.  The gap is narrow  as you reach the green,
with  water and  sand left and another  big bunker on the right at the 91-yard
mark.  The putting  surface is 36 yards  in length with water hugging the left
and a closely-mown area right. The smart play is to layup short of the neck in
the fairway and pinch a wedge for birdie.

Brilliant and diabolical -- two words that come into mind when standing on the
eighth tee. The longest of the four par threes at 240 yards, this gem features
a  lake on  the left side and  a long, undulating putting surface. Mounding on
the right blocks out part of the green, which is OK, since that's the bail out
spot. Par here and you're better than most.

The  longest par four on the course at 485 yards, the closer on the front side
is  a two-parter. First  is the tee shot which requires a blast over a lengthy
sand  trap  on the right.  Even with a successful  tee ball, you're still left
with  a long  second for part two.  Your approach towards the green must avoid
the  lake on the  right which starts at the 150-yard mark and wraps around the
green.  A pair  of traps cover the left  side, just in case you wanted to bail
out. At 41 paces, this putting surface is one of the longest on the course.

Not  only is the  10th hole completely out of character for the Meadow Valleys
course,  but it's  also borderline unfair. You see, the short dogleg-right par
four  is so deeply treelined, that some of the branches actually hang over the
fairway.  So not the  norm, this is the only hole on the course with this much
foliage. OK, enough ranting. You'll need a fairway-metal or long-iron down the
left  side to  open up a clear  shot towards the green. The putting surface is
guarded  by a deep  bunker short-left, a series of pot bunkers back-left and a
pot  bunker  right. The fairly  small, sloping green  can create havoc on your
putter.

Back  into  the open  spaces, the  11th is  a dogleg-left  par five that wraps
around  an enormous,  triangular-shaped bunker. Cut off as much as you choose,
but  you'll have  to bust a drive of  almost 300 yards to clear the end of the
trap.  Best bet is to play to the right and you'll still have a go towards the
green.  Moguls down the right side of the layup area must be avoided to set up
and easy approach to the raised putting surface. A very deep trap on the right
side sits well below the two-tiered green that slopes hard from back to front.
Birdie chance, yes, but bogey or worse can happen very easily.

The  most difficult  hole on the back  side, the 12th is a robust, dogleg-left
par  four reaching 461 yards from the tips. The drive must dissect the fairway
traps  on either side of the landing area or you'll be forced with a difficult
decision  of laying up or crossing the split fairway. A draw towards the right
side  will leave a medium- to long-iron, uphill approach to one of the longest
greens on the course at 42 paces. No traps guarding the putting surface, but a
steep  slope on the left falls off towards Weeden's Creek, forcing your second
to be spot on.

No.  13 is  another dogleg-left, this time in  the form of a short par four of
just 341 yards. The tee shot is critical, as you must clear the creek fronting
the  fairway and  avoid the  sand left  and thick  weeds right.  Fairway-metal
should  do  the trick, however  this will leave a  steep, uphill approach to a
fairly  flat  putting surface. Miss  this green  left and you'll find yourself
well below the green and right is no bargain either where sand awaits.

Reading your yardage book will certainly help when you reach the 14th. A sharp
dogleg right, downhill par four, this hole requires intense strategy or you'll
be  playing  from the  weeds. Your  tee shot  is partially  blind, as the hole
sweeps  towards the right and down to the green, so fairway-metal is the play.
The  big  stick can  run through  the landing  area and  into some tall, thick
grass.  Your approach to  the green must be calculated to the ""Nth"" degree, as
the  pin sits 40 feet below and is surrounded by the aforementioned creek, not
to mention a pair of bunkers deep. Another putting surface over 40 paces, this
one can be a bear, especially when the stick is back-right.

I  hate when  par threes are always  rated as the easiest holes on the course,
especially when they turn out to be some of the most difficult. Case in point:
the  227-yard 15th.  Not only will you  need to strike a long-iron or fairway-
metal  to  perfection, but you'll have  to carry the entire ravine of Weeden's
Creek  to  get home. Although there  are no bunkers,  the green is 48 paces in
length and features several swales throughout. By the way, the putting surface
sits out in the open, so the elements will certainly come into play.

A difficult driving hole, the par-five 16th bends to the right playing as long
as  550 yards.  The elevated fairway is difficult to view, as massive mounding
shields  the landing area. Getting home in two is possible, but you'll have to
feather a left-to-right shot through a narrow opening. The smart play would be
to  layup, short and  left of the 100-yard, lake-like bunker on the right that
runs  through the green.  This will enable you to put some spin on a wedge and
attack the flag. Go for it!

The  shortest hole  on the course, the  17th will most likely make you scratch
your  head and wonder what  Mr. Dye had in mind when he put a tree in front of
the green. That's right, an old maple tree guards the putting surface, forcing
the player to loft a high, soft approach towards the large and relatively flat
green.  Short and  left of the green is  trouble with a capital T, as a ravine
wraps around the port side. No bunkers, but swales and chipping areas mark the
right side.

One  of the prettiest and dramatic finishing holes in golf, the 18th at Meadow
Valleys  is  a picturesque,  458-yard par four  which crosses Sheboygan River.
From  an elevated tee box, you'll need to shape your drive from right to left,
avoiding the rough, trees and river down the right. Played as the ninth during
the  1998  U.S. Women's  Open, the hole  features two greens:  one for the red
markers, which sits at the end of the fairway prior to the water; and one that
stands on the other side. Following a successful drive, a medium- to long-iron
can  remain to  the monstrous putting surface  that lurks ever so close to the
water  and below the massive clubhouse. The green's not tricky, but its length
can add two clubs to your approach. A classic closing hole.

RIVER  COURSE - It's called the River Course for good reason, as the Sheboygan
River  Valley runs  through much of the venue, especially down the entire left
side  of  the opening hole.  Aptly named Snake, the  first winds around to the
left  and then  the right. In all, it's  a modest 564-yard par five and a good
starting hole. Avoid the fairway bunker down the right and you'll have a go to
get  home. If not,  your layup must dissect the pair of bunkers on either side
of  the landing area. At 48 paces, the green is the longest on the course with
a ridge in the center. A back-left pin can make for a difficult par.

Another  breather of sorts,  the second is a straightaway par four of just 376
yards.  The  key is the  tee ball,  which must avoid  the thick trees left and
mounding down the right. No fairway traps, but missing right could result in a
lost  ball  with the thick, native  grasses. The putting surface is narrow and
slick,  running from front to back and to the right. Four greenside traps will
keep you honest, but No. 2 could yield a few birdies.

In  contrast, the third is the No. 1 handicap hole on the course, reaching 461
yards from the tips and bending sharply to the right. You'll need to avoid the
gaping  bunker  and group of trees  down the right  side to have any chance at
getting  home in regulation. Even with a successful tee shot, you're left with
a  medium- to  long-iron home to an  r-shaped green. From 150 yards out on the
right  and  through the green,  stands an  enormous fairway bunker. Along with
native  grasses to  the left  and behind  the putting  surface, this  hole has
certainly earned its moniker: ""Gotcha.""

One  of the  many signature holes at  Blackwolf Run, the par-three fourth is a
beauty.  With a lake guarding the entire right side and with the ever-changing
winds  coming  off the water, this  195-yarder can be a bit frightful. Bailing
out  left will  not guarantee an easy  up and down, as several mounds take the
place of sand. Even with a safe tee shot, the putting surface is long and when
the pin is back-right, good luck!

From  an  elevated tee, the  view on the fifth  is sensational on this medium-
length  par four. The fairway is generous, but two bunkers -- one on the right
side  and  one left  -- must  be avoided. Your  approach to  the green will be
uphill  to  a slick surface. Make  sure to add a  club or two or you'll end up
short  and right  of the green, which  will leave an impossible blind chip, or
worse,  a date with  a miniscule pot bunker. I was lucky to make three, but my
partner was not as fortunate.

A  real birdie chance  awaits when you reach the sixth tee. Accuracy rules the
roost  on  this downhill, dogleg-right par  four, one of five under 400 yards.
Trees and the River Valley line the right, so play down the left to set up the
best  approach to  one of the smallest  greens on the course. Remember to take
one  less  club for your second  as you attack  the pin. One trap protects the
right  portion of the putting surface, which features a rise in the center and
is  quite slick  from back to front. At  28 yards in length, only the ninth is
smaller.

At  the  farthest juncture  on  the  course, you  now  head  back towards  the
clubhouse  at  the dogleg-left, par-four  seventh. At  401 yards, it's not the
longest  hole,  but it's  certainly one  of the most  demanding, as a 110-yard
bunker  guards the  left fairway and deep rough and native grasses protect the
right.  A mid-iron should  remain to a tiny green guarded by a deep, cavernous
bunker  on the  right (believe me, I  was in it). The putting surface is small
and undulating and, despite its size, could produce a few three-putts.

Without  a doubt, the  eighth is one of the most intimidating tee shots on the
course.  From an elevated  tee box and through a chute of trees, there is more
here  than meets  the eye. The beginning  of the fairway is not visible due to
trees  and thick underbrush  and the landing area is tightened due to the tall
foliage  on the right. Rest assured, this par five can be had -- you just need
some  confidence and  a yardage  book. You'll  have several  options from  the
fairway  to  choose from, as it  doglegs to the  right. Going for the green is
risky,  but  possible, and  you'll need  to crack  a big  second into a narrow
putting surface with trees right and sand left. Next is a layup left, which is
the  prudent  play, although it  will leave an  uphill approach to a partially
blind  putting surface.  Another  choice is  to play  out  towards the  right,
elevated  fairway, as this  will leave a straight shot to the green. Favor the
right  of the green, as any shot just off the mark left will fall hard towards
sand and deep hollows.

Another  one  of the stellar  holes on the River  Course is the short par-four
ninth.  A  great  risk-reward gem  at  337  yards,  this  hole can  be  played
conservatively  or  with guns-a-blazin'.  The river runs  hard down the entire
right  side of  the  hole, while  a  group of  trees stand  tall  in the  same
vicinity,  guarding the right fairway and your line of sight to the green. The
sensible  play is  down  the  left side  with  a  fairway-metal or  long-iron,
avoiding  the pot bunker at the 92-yard mark. A little wedge will suffice to a
green  that  slopes  towards the  water,  which  is,  as  the group  Yes  once
proclaimed, ""Close to the edge, down by the river."" If you decide to give it a
go,  you'll  need a  blast of  300 yards  and a  little luck  to slip past the
strategically  placed fairway bunkers. Brain wins out over brawn 95 percent of
the time.

The  longest  of the  par threes,  the 10th  reaches 222  yards from the black
markers.  Water right  and rear should not come into play, however the 70-yard
trap  down the  right side will. The  opening to the putting surface is benign
and  a great place to bail out just in case bad thoughts creep into your mind.
Don't  go after a back-right pin. Play to the heart of the green, two-putt and
move on. One of these days I'll listen to my own advice.

Intimidating.  That's all  I can say about  standing on the 11th tee. First of
all,  the hole bends to a right angle. It runs 560 yards, and, by the way, the
river  runs down the  entire right side of the hole through the green! Several
trees  and sand  guard the landing area off  the tee, not to mention a trio of
traps to clear down the left. It's your second shot which will make you squirm
just  a bit. You  must favor the left side, as the water tightens the fairway.
Gamble  if you dare, as you try to cut off as much as you can. A short-iron or
wedge will remain to a fairly long green. Remember, water runs down the right,
so don't flirt with a nasty pin.

If you thought the first two holes on the inward nine were difficult, the 12th
is  no  picnic either. Rated the  No. 2 handicap  hole on the course, this par
four  requires a  250-yard forced carry over  water and sand just to reach the
fairway.  Even  with a successful shot,  you'll still have a couple of hundred
yards  to the green. Don't forget: the Sheboygan is running down the right and
comes dangerously close to the putting surface. Mounding down the left and one
bunker in the rear will keep you honest. Make par here and, as NBC commentator
Mark Rolfing once said, you're ""Better than most!""

The  13th  concludes a stretch of  four holes that  rank among the best in the
state,  if  not the  country. This par  three borders on  unfair from the back
tees, as tall trees block a portion of the putting surface and, yes, the river
winds  around to  the right. Demanding would be an understatement. The putting
surface  is  also the longest on  the course at  53 paces and with its shallow
creek bed, some days you're hitting over fly-fishing sportsmen.

Like  most of  us recreational  golfers, you've  reached the  14th hole  after
crashing  and burning on the previous quartet and you're upset. So, instead of
taking out the long-iron or fairway-metal, you reach for the big stick on this
short  par four. You'll have to contend with Swan Lake on the right, but there
is  plenty of  room on the left, so  let it fly. No fairway bunkers to contend
with,  just some  mounding and you'll have  just a little wedge remaining to a
fairly  long green. A safe tee ball will give you a real birdie chance, one of
the few remaining on the course.

Finally  an  easy hole --  well, it  should be. The  No. 18 handicap hole, the
short,  par-four 15th  requires just a fairway-metal to navigate the very wide
and  accommodating  fairway. There is  plenty of sand  to contend with on both
sides  of  the landing  area, hence  the name ""Sand  Pit,"" but  even I hit the
fairway.  Your approach towards the green plays downhill, which will make club
selection  crucial, as  a gaping  bunker short  and left  sits well  below the
putting  surface  and seems to  get plenty of  action. Native grasses long and
left provide even more excitement for the errant golfer. Easy? I think not.

The  winding par-five  16th can reach to  580 yards from the tips, as it plays
downhill  towards the green. Each shot on this hole is quite demanding, from a
tee  shot which should  favor the bunkered left side, to the layup which needs
to  be placed down the right to avoid the Linden tree, and, finally, the green
approach,  where the river comes into to play on the left. The putting surface
is  long  and stands  above the edge  of the water.  A well-struck third could
leave a birdie chance to one of the flattest greens on the course.

With  a pond lurking on the left, the 17th can play very tricky, despite being
the  shortest hole  on the course. At  just 175 yards, this par three requires
pinpoint  accuracy off the tee, especially with a back pin. The roller-coaster
putting surface is long and narrow and will require every bit of skill you can
muster with the flat stick.

It's  called  ""Dyehard"" for a  reason. Well, plenty  of reasons. First of all,
as  the  closing hole on  the River Course, it's  supposed to be hard. Second,
this  par four wraps hard to the left with the Sheboygan running alongside it.
Next,  469  yards from the tips  and a meandering waste-bunker with mounds and
hollows  running throughout. If that wasn't enough, there is a 50-yard fairway
bunker  and native  grasses guard the landing area to the right. The long-iron
or  fairway-metal  that awaits is struck  towards a long, open green that runs
slightly  from back  to front.  Shared  with the  18th on  the Meadow  Valleys
course, this green sits below the rustic and stately clubhouse in full view of
your achievement and possible disappointment.

FINAL WORD: They say that Wisconsin is known for cheese, the Green Bay
Packers, drinking (beer capital of the world) and Happy Days. Yes, the hit TV
show was centered around Arnold's Drive-In in Milwaukee.

But golf, could it be? Oh yes, in a big way.

The four courses in Kohler are some of the finest in the country, and the
twosome at Blackwolf Run are awesome.

Let's start out with the amenities.

You'll be hard-pressed to find a staff more accommodating and generous than
the team at Blackwolf Run. From the pro shop to the golf course to the locker
room and restaurant, the personnel are extremely knowledgeable and forever
hustling.

If it's merchandise you want, then the golf shop is the place to be. Fully
stocked with clubs, men's and women's attire, logo balls, hats, etc...You get
the picture, all adorned with the creative Blackwolf Run moniker.

The rustic clubhouse, almost 40,000 square feet, is perched above the 18th
holes of both courses, features vaulted ceilings, a massive fireplace and
Native American artifacts. Built of Canadian pine logs, the clubhouse features
sensational views of the course and the forever winding Sheboygan River.

If it's food you want, then sit at the bar or in the restaurant and sample
some of the local fare or any of the succulent morsels. If it's me, I go for
the Chicken Bruschetta appetizer, followed by the Spiced Kobe Bistro Steak and
topped off with Triple Vanilla Creme Brulee and Warm Brownie Sundae. Toss in a
bottle of wine and your meal is complete.

Back to the golf. The courses, Meadow Valleys and River, offer two different
styles of design.

The Meadow Valleys layout is certainly more forgiving of the two, with
generous fairways and wide open spaces. This course is a natural paradise,
complete with deep ravines, elevation changes, wispy native grasses and the
ever-present Sheboygan River and Weeden's Creek. Water actually comes into
play on seven holes, including the wonderful 18th. The course also features a
pair of railroad car bridges, one on the 13th and the other between the 14th
green and 15th tee. Although two holes on the Meadow Valleys course, the 10th
and 17th, do not suit me (I did par both), this is a wonderful tract that is
quite enjoyable.

The River Course is without a doubt the better of the two, with its large
undulating greens, rambunctious fairways, strategic bunkering and target-style
golf. Water is quite evident on this layout, with the River coming into play
on no less than 14 of the 18 holes. Stretching to just over 7,000 and with
plenty of danger at every turn, it's no wonder that the slope is 148. The
quartet of par threes, highlighted by the tough 13th, are some of the finest
in the land.

Both courses feature four sets of tees, so all skill levels can compete on
these well-conditioned beauties. Pete Dye outdid himself when crafting these
two gems. ""In designing Blackwolf Run, we wanted to make a resort-type course
where players of varying ability will enjoy themselves,"" said Dye. ""I put a
gambling element into the courses, where the player will be greatly rewarded
for taking a chance, but penalized if the gamble fails.""

The awards continue to roll in for both layouts, as they rank in the top-10 in
the state and the top-100 in America. Along with the amazing accommodations of
the American Club, satisfaction is guaranteed. Don't take my word for it, just
ask Travel + Leisure magazine, which rated the venue as Best Golf Resort in
the Midwest and the eighth best in the United States.

You'll be tested, awed and thrilled to experience the wonderful layouts of
Blackwolf Run. The USGA and PGA Tour have stopped here...why shouldn't you?"

Golfers pursue playing The River as it has hosted a variety of championships. However, in recent years, Blackwolf Run has been pushed to the back burner. This is due to the opening of several new golf courses cropping up across Wisconsin. In this golf course review, I will cover whether Blackwolf Run should maintain its top spot in the state.

Course Background
Blackwolf Run, in Kohler, WI, is home to two golf courses; The River and Meadow Valleys. Opening in 1988, it was rated as the “Best New Public Course” by Golf Digest. The courses have hosted a few championships including the Andersen Consulting World Golf and US Women’s Open.

Blackwolf Run achitect, Pete Dye, includes his signature features such as bunkering and railroad ties. The golf course is designed to be difficult requiring precision and shot-making. Weave in a winding river and water on 14 of 18 holes and you have a challenging day.

Sign cautioning of severe drop off
Pete Dye architecture can be scary
Course Playability
The River is set up to be a riding golf course. This is made obvious by the paved cart paths weaving throughout the grounds. I made the decision to walk The River during my round. This decision was noticed by employees including the starter and beverage cart attendants.

The River sits on a vast property with many holes situated a few hundreds yards away. The setup is not conducive to walking and felt more like a resort course than I would have liked.

The golf course design shows its age by being built in the 1980s. This era was known for penal golf design where water and length were the defense. Since that time, there has been a shift by architects to find new ways to challenge golfers. Those principles include angles and undulating greens.

Many holes wrap around some kind of water hazard
Golf Experience
Kohler Destination golf courses are designed as a full golfing experience. They include four brilliant golf courses; The Straits, The Irish, The River and Meadow Valleys. These courses are some of the best in the state of Wisconsin. The experience is heightened by the lodging and dining.

The rates for The River are steep. During the summer, a round of golf can be ~$250-300 plus a caddie fee. Caddie fees are $70 per person plus a $50 tip. In most cases, caddies will carry two bags.

Visitors will be blown away by the Village of Kohler. Driving through Kohler brings a feeling of Pleasantville. Round out your golfing experience by bringing a spouse. The American Club just a mile away from the course and offers a great itinerary for couples.

Finally, the on-course experience is very enjoyable. Course conditions will be in the best shape for the season. We had a beautiful Spring day for golf that was accentuated by a gorgeous course as the backdrop.

Memorable Golf Holes
Hole 5 – Par 4, 388 yards
The 5th hole, named Made in Heaven, is the first elevated tee shot for golfers at The River. The yardage will not scare anyone unless the wind is blowing. A reasonable wind will require precision off the tee to avoid well-positioned fairway bunkers. The approach shot to an elevated green is difficult. Distance control is critical for a birdie, let along par.

Hole 9 – Par 4, 316 yards
The last hole of the first nine named Cathedral Spires, is a short par 4 measuring only 316 yards. Golfers could hit 7-iron/7-iron into the green for a comfy par, but that is not what Pete Dye intended. The architect baits golfers to go directly at the green. At only a 240 yards carry many will attempt the shot. The winding river on the right needs to be ignored in order for a committed swing. The green is well-guarded with bunkers. Enjoy this one.

Hole 12 – Par 4, 423 yards
Hole 12 named Long Lagoon, is a challenging par 4 – especially when playing into the wind. Golfers will decide to aim at one of two landing areas. The more aggressive line (left) will leave a better angle with a mid-iron approach shot. From the right, players must take on the Sheboygan River with a long-iron in hand. Par is an excellent score here.

Golf Course Review Final Thoughts
The River is a beautiful golf course. No question. Destination Kohler pulls out all the stops to make a memorable experience for golfers. However, if you only going for the golf, I cannot recommend The River as a must-play. The golf rates do not match the golf course. The course architecture does not promote fun for all skill levels. I would lose credibility on this golf blog and golf course review if I recommended The River at Blackwolf Run."
119,Black Creek Golf Club,non100,"Chattanooga, TN",Brian Silva,2000,"Black Creek Golf Club (Chattanooga, Tennessee)",Bill Satterfield,rev119_black_creek_club_1,"What to Expect:  Black Creek is a throwback in time with regards to golf course architecture. When Charles Blair Macdonald and Seth Raynor started designing golf courses in America during the early part of the 20th century, they implemented many of the successful features found in European courses. Some hole designs were so popular that they became templates that were modeled on multiple courses. Brian Silva’s design that opened at the beginning of the 21st century features several of these template holes including Biarritz, Redan, Double Plateau, and Punchbowl. While I normally look forward to seeing something new at a golf course, template holes are so successful in their combination of strategy and fun that I find myself getting just as excited to play them as I do a hole design I’ve never seen before. The course is characterized by sharp angles that create square/rectangular greens and bunkers. The bunkers are flat bottomed and deep creating a hazard to be avoided for sure. The firm fairways coupled with the strong green contours make the ground game a large part of the strategy and success at Black Creek. There were more homes on the course (particularly the front nine) then I was expecting, but in a time where the old template holes aren’t celebrated enough; Black Creek is an enjoyable success.
Individual Hole Analysis
Signature Hole:  17th (Biarritz) Hole – 243 Yard Par 3 – If you’ve read many of my reviews then you know of my love for Biarritz holes. Black Creek adopts modern day length in their design so that the hole could play similarly to how the original design was intended; running it up with a fairway wood. The green features bunkers running along both sides and the swell in the middle of the green is a good 3-4 feet. Brian Silva did an excellent job staying true to the integrity and enjoyment factor of this classic design.
17th (Biarritz) Hole at Black Creek Golf Club (243 Yard Par 3)
Best Par 3:  11th (Redan) Hole – 195 Yards – Another classic favorite of mine, after seeing Reverse Redan on the front nine you are greeted by Redan on the back. This rendition doesn’t play as true to other versions I’ve played due to the elevated tee which tends make approach shots stick rather than hit and roll left. However, with the Reverse Redan on the front nine that plays more purely, this hole provides a nice variation.
11th (Redan) Hole at Black Creek Golf Club (195 Yard Par 3)
Best Par 4:  9th (Black Creek) Hole – 431 Yards – The best par four at Black Creek is not a template hole like most of the others on the property, it is an original design and a fine one at that. With the course’s namesake cutting in from the right side across the front of the green, players contend with bunkers off the tee and then the water hazard on the approach shot. A bail out area to the right of the green is offered for those who are a bit faint of heart while a back left pin should only be attacked by the boldest of players at this angled green.
9th (Black Creek) Hole at Black Creek Golf Club (431 Yard Par 4)
Best Par 5:  6th (Punchbowl) Hole – 559 Yards – I absolutely loved this hole! A combination of ‘Sahara’ and ‘Punchbowl,’ this mid-length par five boasts a huge hill just over 100 yards from the green and completely blocks any view of the putting surface. A pole with a target at the top sits behind the green to give golfers an idea of where to hit their approach shot. Once the Sahara hill is carried, the terrain slopes quickly and steadily down towards the green. The grass on the back side of the hill is short enough to allow for a good amount of roll but not short enough to guarantee reaching the green without a fair amount of initial carry. The amount of anticipation that exists on your way to the green to see where your approach shot finished in the punchbowl green is virtually unmatched in golf course design.
6th (Punchbowl) Hole at Black Creek Golf Club (559 Yard Par 5)
Birdie Time:  15th (Cape) Hole – 347 Yard Par 4 – Already a short hole that should have you licking your chops, the 15th also plays downhill and gives you an opportunity to drive the green or at least snuggle up close to it. Other than the trees and marsh area along the left side, there is little trouble to contend with on this hole and the open fairway begs you to grip it and rip it. This is your easiest green in regulation on the day.
15th (Cape) Hole at Black Creek Golf Club (347 Yard Par 4)
Bogey Beware:  13th (Long) Hole – 485 Yard Par 4 – The longest par four at Black Creek also plays uphill thus making a green in regulation a difficult feat. If you try and cut some yardage off by challenging the right corner of this hole as it turns up the hill you will contend with a bunker awaiting tee shots that lack the power needed to find prime position. With the hole framed by trees on both sides and a steady ascending climb to the green, this is one hole where bogies will be lurking even for the best of players.

120,Black Creek Golf Club,non100,"Chattanooga, TN",Brian Silva,2000,BLACK CREEK CLUB,Phil Sokol,rev120_black_creek_club_2,"HISTORY:  When a  course is  only open  for a  short period  of time,  history
usually  does not  fit into the equation, however Black Creek is an exception.
Course  designer  Brian Silva, the  1999 Architect of  the Year by Golf World,
specializes in designing courses that borrow ideas from some of the masters of
his profession, most notably, Seth Raynor and C.B. Macdonald. Black Creek Club
combines  the best of these vintage designers, as their Redan, Punchbowl, Cape
and  Biarritz  holes would indicate.  Silva  along  with partner  Geoffrey
Cornish,
have  designed some  outstanding venues, mainly in the northeast, such as Cape
Cod  National, Waverly  Oaks and Red Tail Golf Club. Each hole is specifically
named  after a  design philosophy.

History  was made  in 2003,  as the  PGA's developmental  league, the
Nationwide Tour made its mark at Black Creek. When it  was  all said and
done, Jason  Bohn, who birdied  five of the final seven holes  came away  the
winner, as he  defeated Kyle Thompson by one shot. Bohn, who  began the final
round three shots back, fashioned a final-round 64, which included  a  10-foot
birdie on  the final hole, as  he posted his first career title. Bart Bryant
made the biggest move of the tournament, as he stormed from 32nd to a tie for
sixth with a final round, and then course-record 63.

The 2004 event was quite amazing as well. Justin Bolli, who made the cut on
the number, shot rounds of 63-65 over the weekend to overtake Johnson Wagner
and Chris Anderson to win by one shot. Doug Barron set a new course record
with his final round of 62 and tied for fourth. After a bogey at the par-four
10th, Bolli went on a scoring spree with a birdie on 13 from two feet and a
10-foot eagle on the par-five 14th. Continuing his hot play, Bolli birdied
from 20 feet on the 15th and from 10 feet on the 17th. With his up-and-down
birdie at the last, Bolli finally grabbed the lead. Anderson had a chance to
force a playoff, but failed to birdie the last.

The first playoff in event history occurred in 2005, as Jason Schultz
outlasted Jerry Smith, Scott Weatherly and Joe Daley on the sixth extra hole.
Schultz, who shared the lead entering the final round, had a chance to win in
regulation, but three-putted the final hole to create the playoff. Weatherly
and Smith were eliminated on the first extra hole, as both Schultz and Daley
birdied the 18th. After halving the next four holes, the playoff continued on
the par-four ninth. Both players found the fairway with their tee shots, then
dropped their second shots on the putting surface. Schultz poured in a 20-foot
birdie putt, while Daley missed from 10-feet for birdie giving Schultz his
first tour win.

Records were broken in 2006, as Kyle Reifers carded a course-record of 61 in
the final round and then edged Brandt Snedeker in a playoff to register his
first career title. Making his professional debut after graduating from Wake
Forest, Reifers birdied the first extra hole to win the Chattanooga Classic.
With the victory, Reifers became the 11th player to win his first start on the
Nationwide Tour and the 19th player in Tour history to win as a Monday
qualifier. The tournament was not without drama, as Snedeker eagled the 72nd
hole to get into the playoff and join Reifers at 26-under-par 262, a new
tournament record.

REVIEW:  The course  starts off with a solid par-four, bending slightly to the
right  following  a downhill  tee shot. The  one thing you  will notice on the
front  nine is  the residential-lined  holes  throughout the  outward nine.  A
slight  drawback  considering the  beauty of  the course.  Getting back to the
action, a fairway bunker some 320 yards off the tee is an excellent target, as
this  hole favors a fade on your opening shot. This will leave a short iron to
a  very narrow green with sand right and left. The putting surface slopes from
back  to front and features a pair of ridges, hence the name ""Double Plateau.""
The  second is  a dogleg left par-four, that  requires a draw off the tee to a
fairway  protected both right and left with sand. In fact, three-wood might be
the  play,  as the left  bunker is  273 yards. Remember,  the hole is a dogleg
left, so don't confuse the very visible third green which sits to the right (I
did).  The  putting surface is  actually snug against the  base of a hill with
grass  swales left  and right.  A definite  birdie hole,  as the  green slopes
gently  from  left to  right. The first  signature hole on  the course is most
definitely  the  third. This  shortish par-three  of just  168 yards is played
downhill  to  a green which  is surrounded by  four large bunkers. The putting
surface  features a horseshoe swale in the center, so make sure you select the
right  club  so your  tee shot can  be on the  correct side  of the green or a
three-putt  could  be  in the  offing.  The  course  gets  its name  from  the
meandering  body of  water that wanders throughout the layout, Black Creek. It
first shows up on the par-five fifth. A fairly straightforward hole, the creek
cuts  in  front of the tee  box and ventures its  way up the right side of the
hole within 100 yards of the green. The bailout side is obviously on the left,
however  Silva, created  some  interesting dilemmas.  First  a 50-yard  bunker
protects  the  left side along with  native grasses. Second, with the creek on
the  right,  the landing area  off the tee is  very narrow. Your approach shot
must  be played down the right side, as to set up the best angle to the green,
which  is set off  the left. The putting surface is protected on the left side
by a daunting bunker, while the green itself is broken into three quadrants of
slope, making par a good score.

Accuracy,  not  length is the  key on  the sixth. A  short par four by today's
standards  at 375 yards, this hole requires a fairway metal or an iron off the
tee,  as a huge bunker right of the fairway stands in plain view. A short-iron
approach  must clear the  marsh area at the end of the fairway to a very small
green, protected left by sand and right by a shaved chipping area. The putting
surface is fairly simple, so birdies can be made. Although the longest hole on
the  course  at 562 yards, the  par-five sixth can  be reached in two. It also
features  the ""Punchbowl"" style of Macdonald and Raynor. A small bunker in the
middle  of  the fairway,  250 yards  out must be  avoided to  have any shot at
getting  home. After  a  successful tee  shot,  the player  is  left with  two
choices,  go for  the green or layup.  Either way, birdie or better is likely.
Laying  up will leave a 100-125 yard blind shot to a green that sits down. Aim
for the directional target behind the green. Missing left or right will end up
fine,  as  the 14,000 square  foot green slopes to  the center, leaving a sure
birdie  attempt. Go for the green, a three-metal must be struck with precision
in order to clear the bunkers that sit atop a knoll 70 yards shy of the green.
If  successful, your  second shot  should roll  up onto  the green,  leaving a
definite eagle opportunity. From the longest par-five to the longest par-three
on  the  course, the seventh  is a  brute at 244  yards from the tips. Playing
slightly  downhill,  the hole requires  a fade off  the tee and plays slightly
easier  than  the yardage  indicates due  to the  hillside to  the left of the
green.  Short and right  could spell doom with a deep abyss bunker. Your short
game  will  be tested here  in order  to make par.  The eighth is a strategic,
dogleg  right par-four,  as its  376-yard length  would indicate.  Directional
bunkers  protect the landing  area in each and every way, so picking the right
club off the tee can make all the difference. Bunkers left and right guard the
landing area at 220 yards out. More sand occupies the corner of the dog leg on
the  right, 250 yards  away from the tee. And for the big hitters, how about a
pot  bunker in  the center of the  fairway, 295 yards out. Now the fun begins,
the green, shaped like a square is flanked on the right by sand and features a
""thumbprint""  swale in the center of the surface. No question, the easiest pin
position  is the center of the green, however, back right or left and be happy
making  par.  Somewhat similar to The  Honors Course's ninth hole, the closing
hole on the front is an outstanding par-four, stretching 435 yards with out of
bounds  left and right. Let's not forget the sand on the right (224 yards out)
and  left (274 yards  away). Usually into the wind, the player is left with an
intimidating  second shot that must cross Black Creek, which runs on the right
side  of the fairway crossing the front and left portion of the green. Bailing
out right, your shot will land in a shaved chipping area or worse, you guessed
it,  another deep bunker.  To make matters worse, the green is broken up in to
three distinct quadrants, making putting a difficult chore.

If  you  thought the front  nine was outstanding, wait  to you play the inward
holes.  No homes, no townhouses, just beautiful scenery and one difficult golf
course.  The 10th is  a certain risk-reward type hole. Just 339 yards from the
tips  and  playing downhill,  a player has  the option of  going long with the
driver  or playing safe  with a fairway metal or iron. With the big stick, the
player  must go right  over the two deep fairway bunkers, as the greens is set
to  that side. Do  not miss left off the tee or run through the fairway, as it
drops  severely into an abyss. The layup approach will leave a sand wedge to a
plateaued  green  that features the deepest  bunker on the course. The putting
surface  is  fairly flat,  so birdies  can certainly  kickstart your nine. Yet
another  picturesque hole,  the 11th is a downhill par-three of 181 yards. The
rectangular  green  is protected  in front and  back by a  pair of deep trench
bunkers. The putting surface slopes from back to front and is extremely quick.
Some of the finest golf on the back nine awaits the player as he stands on the
12th  tee. Black Creek's version of ""Amen Corner"" starts with a dangerous par-
four  of 462 yards.  With the signature creek running the entire right side of
the  fairway, the  player must bomb a  tee shot down the left side towards the
two  framing  bunkers 307  yards out. A  mid- to long-iron  will remain as the
second  shot  must cross  the creek  which cuts  right in  front of the green,
reminiscent  of the ninth. Bail out right, as the green drops severely down to
the  water. The  putting surface has little undulation, so getting up-and-down
should  be an  easy task. The second  handicap hole on the course, the 13th is
another  brute  at 458  yards. Requiring a  fade off the  tee, the player must
avoid  the  fairway bunker set  in the right-center  of the fairway, 250 yards
out. By the way, Black Creek runs the entire left side of the hole through the
green.  The second shot, which plays uphill should necessitate a mid- to long-
iron  to  a narrow green that  slopes from back to  front and falls off on the
right  and left. Making par on either one of these two holes or both will be a
miracle.  The par-five 14th,  with one of the most scenic views on the course,
concludes  the  outstanding threesome  of holes.  The climb to  the tee box is
40-50  feet above  the previous green and provides a beautiful panorama of the
course.  Getting back  to business, the tee  shot must be played from right to
left,  as the hole  will kick all balls to the right. This hole can be reached
in two, however the second shot must clear a cluster of deep bunkers which sit
50 to 100 yards short of the green. The putting surface, rectangular in shape,
is  raised and  slopes from left to  right. A large collection area awaits the
player  who bails  out right of the green, which will make getting up-and-down
very  difficult. The  15th is a birdie  hole, but beware as water hazards loom
large  down the left.  Just 353 yards, the hole plays shorter than its yardage
indicates  due to  its downhill nature. A  driver with a draw can be played in
attempts to reach the green, however if your less than perfect, you'll be left
with  a tough  pitch from the undulating  fairway to a small green that slopes
from back to front. Water left and sand right protects the putting surface, so
don't  be ashamed making four (I wish I did). The 16th is somewhat simple...or
is it? 417 yards and downhill from the tee, the fairway features four bunkers,
two  down the right  side requiring a 250-yard carry and two in the center 290
yards  away.  Your second  shot  now  must be  very  accurate  as the  narrow,
rectangular  green is protected  right and left by sand and in the center by a
spine  that runs the  entire surface. You'll either love it or hate it, as you
play  the  17th. Fashioned after the  ""Biarritz"" style, the hole resembles the
ninth at Yale Golf Club with a 65-yard deep green with a huge, five-foot swale
in  the  center of the green.  This hole can play  as little as 180 yards from
tips  or  it can stretch to  225 with the pin  in the back. The 18th will test
your  strength and  your mind. The home  hole features Lake Silva on the left,
which  stretches from  the tee  box  down the  fairway. This  par-five can  be
reached in two, but the player must flirt with the water down the left to have
any  shot. There  is now  shame in  laying up  short of  Black Creek,  leaving
yourself  a 100-yard pitch. The green is protected by sand right and left with
an  additional bunker further left for those players attempting to get home in
two. The putting surface slopes from back to front, providing for many anxious
moments.

OVERALL: There  is no question that Black Creek will climb the rankings as the
years go by.  The  beauty and style  of the course are  outstanding. Black
Creek is not just a players course, it features four sets of markers starting
at 5200 yards and  stretching to 7088. How about a perfect practice facility
set at the base of  Raccoon  Mountain. The only things  that put a  damper on
the course in my eyes  are the homes on the front nine, which takes away from
the beauty of the course  and the 17th green. Raynor and Macdonald aside,
there is no reason for that  putting surface, which actually penalizes good
shots. Be that as it may, Black Creek is a must play if your in the area. Make
sure you check in the pro shop  for key  tidbits and local knowledge  on how
to play certain holes. This will  make your round more enjoyable. Conveniently
located on the outskirts of Chattanooga,  Black  Creek offers  players a
chance to compete  on one of the finest  layouts in the state. Silva created a
masterpiece of angles and shapes with  outstanding bunkering throughout. It's
certainly a course that makes you think,  with many different  options on each
and every hole, and one that will entice  you  to come  back again and  again.
Even when  your done, you'll have plenty  of time to sit on the backporch, sip
a cocktail and admire the 9th and 18th holes. This is one course you will not
get tired of playing and viewing."
